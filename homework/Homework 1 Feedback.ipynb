    "### Use Word Boundaries For Regex Patterns\n",
    "Since we are using regex to group together relevant **words** into themes, we want to make sure that our regex patterns do not match false positives. A common theme selected by students was `TIME`, or how long customers had to wait to receive their orders. A frequent pattern used was `(?:long|forever|waittime|waiting|wait|slow)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem with this pattern is that is will [match the following words](regexr.com/6i9nk):\n",
    "* `await`\n",
    "* `waiter`\n",
    "* `along`\n",
    "* `belong`\n",
    "\n",
    "These are false positives that can, depending on hw frequently they appear, completely alter the final recommendations/findings. Using word boundaries, `\\b(?:long|forever|waittime|waiting|wait|slow)\\b`, will reduce the [number of false positives matched](regexr.com/6i9nt).\n",

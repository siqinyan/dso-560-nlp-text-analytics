    "Students would first perform a word count to check for the top frequency words - then, they'd use their domain knowledge to select stopwords to add to the list. For instance, if you look carefully, many of the reviews contain `<br>` or `<br/>`. This is an HTML tag for a line break. This is definitely a word that should just be completely removed - you will catch this if you remove all non alphanumeric characters, tokenize, and perform a word count: `br` shows up as one of the top reoccuring words."

    "* `min_df=0.03` is actually quite high a bar. This means that the word needs to appear in 3% of all reviews. Given that the entire dataset (good + poor reviews) is 115k, this means the word needs to appear in 3,450 reviews or more to make it as a final feature. This actually means there's a very good chance it's a stopword! Especially since the product reviews are frequently about a wide variety of different toy products, you should inspect the final features you get and do a sanity-check to make sure they seem to be useful. You can also set a `max_df=UPPER_THRESHOLD` to limit stopwords that appear in too many documents.\n",
    "* we should be ideally using `binary=True` to offsite the possibility someone just writes the same word over and over again in the same review"

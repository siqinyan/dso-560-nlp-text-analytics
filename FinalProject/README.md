# DSO560 Final Project -- Sentiment Analysis: Steam Reviews 

## Problem Statement
As data scientists at Steam, we develop AI solutions for operation optimization.

At Steam, the largest digital distribution platform for PC gaming, we have millions of reviews for the 50,000+ games. However, there is no clear signal whether the review creator likes the game or not. 

To extract information from these reviews and conclude as their sentiment for game recommendation, we want to build solid models with our 70,000 manually-labeled reviews, each with a tag “if recommended” generated by human.

With trained models, we could then conduct user preferences analysis and generate actionable insights accordingly to stakeholders.

## Sentiment Predection
We first built models on *notebooks* for debugging. 

[BOW models](https://github.com/siqinyan/dso-560-nlp-text-analytics/blob/main/FinalProject/3_modeling_BOW.ipynb)

[Sequential models](https://github.com/siqinyan/dso-560-nlp-text-analytics/blob/main/FinalProject/3_modeling_sequential.ipynb)

Then, in order to scalably exploring model settings, we developped the *script*().
Sample running: 
` python modeling.py -m lstm -des test1`

We also tested [transformer](https://github.com/siqinyan/dso-560-nlp-text-analytics/blob/main/FinalProject/4_model_comparison.ipynb) on our dataset.

## User Preferences Analysis
We conducted [User Preferences Analysis](https://github.com/siqinyan/dso-560-nlp-text-analytics/blob/main/FinalProject/5_user%20preferences.ipynb) to identify features for users' likes/dislikes.

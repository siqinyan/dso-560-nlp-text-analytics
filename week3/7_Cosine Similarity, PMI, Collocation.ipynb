This McDonalds is also dirty, the floor was covered with dropped food. Obviously filled with surly and unhappy workers.',\n",

This store benefits from being the only place to eat in this area. The next stop is at least 12 minutes away on the other side of town. Also I strongly believe in 2nd chances and know that not every business can satisfy everyone 100% of the time. I have given them many chances at earning a positive review.

Anyway, this location is on a little access road and you have to go back the way you came because there is no exit from it at the other end. It would have helped if there was one.

So we wait about 5 - 10 minutes for our turn to order. We order the specials they were having at that time (20 pcs chicken nuggets for $5) and asked for a cup of water because we didn't want to drink any sodas at that late hour. They take our order but tells us they don't serve cups of water there. So we are a little annoyed but ok we shrug it off and wait our turn to pay and receive our order.

Now my order has been right a few times in a row and my food hot. Also, I love dining room. Usually you wouldn't find me actually inside a fast food joint but this place has nice flooring, stacked stone, lots of large windows and a flat screen TV usually on HLN.

I inquired about that before and was told, that when someone drives off that messes up the order.Well, I guess there's no controlling drive off, and at least I know my order has been confirmed, so it should be right by the time I get to the second window.This McDonald's, also has a late night drive thru Thur - Sat, it use to be a 24 hour on those days, but I don't think it is any longer.

Considering this location is close to the airport it would be great if they could simply improve the quality of service. As a lover of Sweet Tea, I was completely turned off by this location when I overheard the drive thru operator joking about how sweet it was a few years ago. She told a few of her associates that it was like \"syrup\" and \"liquid diabetes\". By the time I took my first and only sip, I was on I-285 headed to Perimeter Mall and it tasted like cold syrup!

Now how is that when they are waiting on their order...hell I was thinking you are holding up the customer and the others waiting.! Anyway finally placed order and was told $1.07, which I paid exact price. Here is where its sad...the cashier did not ring up the soda so therefore I did not get a receipt. I know that she planned to pocket the money, which is sad and bad because eventually that cost will get passed off to customers through price increases. I will not return here because I don\\'t like to feel like I am in someone\\'s \"hood\" and I HATE A THIEF!!! maybe I will call to tell them but then again they probably don\\'t care or maybe even steal themselves. plus I do not eat fast food anyway so no need to waste precious minutes',\n",

In food quality and employee humanity/work effortTypically, I do NOT eat McDonalds food; yet similar to the experience of others \"trapped\" at Northside Hospital there is no other option if you are hungry outside of the hospital cafeteria hours of operation. Due to a relatives stay and my visits/overnights for 11 weeks~ I too found myself \"trapped\" and therefore forced to buy at McDonalds. Mostly my visits were for coffee or ice cream sundaes. However, last night, for the first time I ordered food (grilled chicken salad) I returned it ~ the meat smelled BADLY. This did not surprise me and only enforced my resolve to avoid chain food restaurants.What did surprise me and absolutely SHOCKED me was the customer service offered by employees ~ HOW in the world can you BE an employee here and NOT for ONE MINUTE or even a second acknowledge the obvious FACT that you work inside a HOSPITAL; then consider what that means for each and every person that approaches your counter to order. HOW you do not SEE them, in FACT that you easily DISMISS them, is beyond my comprehension to understand! HOW you lost your sense of humanity, in all honestly should cause you to pause and contemplate this ~ Are you not aware that you are reflecting how YOU measure within YOU your own sense of dignity?Within my and family/friends of patient at Northside Hospital for the past 11 weeks: each and every time I/they had to place an order I /they was/were subjected to McDonalds toxic business model (in food) which now has transferred (we learned) into their employees. NOT once was I thanked for giving my order; NOT ONCE was I thanked when delivered my order. Yet, at EVERY visit I WAITED and witnessed employee behaviors that were readily displayed and relayed in body language, effort toward actual work, and obvious attitude not only toward me, but guests in front of me. God forbid I happened to have question in reference to the menu (employee response: blank stare, shrug, looking behind them at menu only to turn back around with a blank stare and/or shrug again). God forbid, on separate occasions I happened to ask for a spoon/napkin/straw. Last night, I happened to ask for my drink please (after receiving my salad and waiting for longer than normal) YIKES, you think I had asked him to draw blood!***One more detail regardless if I arrive at 2am, 4am or between 7:30 pm ~ 11 pm this McDonalds is ALWAYS consistently FILTHY! Not just dirty, but FILTHY!Can anyone lift a broom to sweep up the garbage in the service/cooking area; also in the dining room?Can anyone clean the crud surrounding the plastic display case for cookies ALREADY? It\\'s been 11 weeks and that crud is STILL smeared dried; just gross.Wash/disinfect the countertops, payment pads, straw holders, everywhere spills occur; including areas customers touch. EVERY HOUR! Get it? Every single hour! GET a cleaning ONLY employee! This employee will do NOTHING but be THE OCD employee you NEED! Just stop this ATROCIOUSLY DIRTY & DISGUSTING feeding trough you call a restaurant. You should be ashamed.**************************************************Î_**************************************Northside Hospital ~ YOU are responsible for allowing this restaurant to wallow within your walls!

However, when I sat down to eat my food in the waiting room, I noticed the sandwich and fries were barely warm, and the ice in my water was almost completely melted. I guess the food had been cooked and sitting out for a while, and they must keep cups of ice water ready to hand out to customers. Boo.

This makes it inconvenient for people who like to stop by McDonald\\'s to use their laptops, which I do quite often.Overall, this McDonald\\'s deserves about 2.5 stars because it\\'s right in between \"meh\" and \"A-OK.\" I know some may say it\\'s \"just a McDonald\\'s,\" but hey - I\\'ve been to numerous other locations where their food is pretty consistent (don\\'t serve COLD fries!) and there are numerous power outlets for customers\\' use.

They're also generous with the condiments when you ask for them (and even when you don't!). Unlike some fast food places that stop serving milkshakes after a certain hour because they've already cleaned the machine, they'll make you a milkshake up until they close. Service is a huge thing for me so the fact that they're always smiling and ready to help me get my fat fix is what makes me partial to this particular location.

By the time I got around to the window, the person that was to take my money and give me my food was way more interested in an argument that was going on outside in the parking lot between two young ladies and the two young men they were with.I'll admit that I too paid attention to the fight in the parking lot to make sure it didn't escalate into gunfire with my car sitting center mass of it all. About six months ago, someone told me they got robbed while sitting in the drive thru at this location, but they were there around 2am and my visit was taking place at 6pm, so I wasn't worried about getting robbed as much as I was about getting shot.After making sure that the parking lot was not about to be shot up, he accepted my cash, asked me if I wanted to wait a minuite and get some hot fries.

This McDonald\\'s location would have gotten 5 stars about 3 months ago, but things have changed. A few months ago, the workers were really cool, but now they have all just gotten really f*cking weird!

Watch out when you are entering this drive-thru because there is a huge chance that some douchebag in a BMW will run the stop sign in order to cut in front of you.When I drove up to the box, there was no answer. About 2 minutes later I begin hearing a ton of static and then this bizarre sounding guy starts talking in this strange tone. He sounded like a drunk Orson Wells. When I pulled up to the first window to pay, the window slowly slid open to reveal the face of a morbid looking kid with gigantic dilated eyes and one of those horror movie smiles. Immediately he lets out this high pitched: \"reeehhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!\" noise at me. At that particular moment, due to the fear of man-rape, I thought about driving over the planters and escaping. But, he looked so weird that I came to the conclusion that he might have some kind of paranormal super powers and would catch me no matter how fast I drove, so I just sat there and awaited my fate. After about 2-3 seconds he told me how much my coffee cost in a disturbingly soft tone voice, and thankfully he didn\\'t serve me McRape. When I drove up to the pick-up window, I was greeted by an anorexic looking latino kid who didn\\'t even give me eye contact, and while holding the coffee he sticks his arm out the window and just drops it before I even have the chance to reach out to grab it.

       " \"Years of pathetic service, disgusting food, and dangerous mistakes. Why do I keep going back?Having nothing to do with Mcdonalds food in general and more to do with the ability of this specific location to produce it with out killing anybody. I have been going to this particular store for years. It is right around the corner from where I used to live, and is on the way from where I live to pretty much everything I use (gas station, costco, movie theater, market, etc). It is the only convenient location, and for a while Mcdonalds was the only place that had $1 drinks. So those are my lame excuses for repeatedly torturing myself with this horrible place! Service: I used to be a manager with another fast food chain. I know what service SHOULD be. I also know what it usually is. It doesn't have to be 5 star. But the rude attitudes, ridiculously slow service, and inability to get a single order right is really a bit too much. When I say slow service, I am talking 15 minutes is average drive thru time for a dollar menu burger and a soda. Correct orders: Yes, my order can occasionally be complicated (no castup, add big mac sauce)... but when I thought they could do no worse... they messed up an order for 4 large drinks. 2 diet cokes, a lemonade, and an unsweet iced tea (all with extra ice). We received a regular coke, a lemonade, a Dr. Pepper, and a sweet iced tea. 2 drinks had no ice at all. and the other 2 had a few pieces floating around. We have never received a correct order from this store. EVER. I could go on and on about it, but I will stick with this sad example and move on.Dangerous/disgusting/incorrectly made: Something a little different then an order where they put the wrong thing in the bag or mess up a custom, is when they just make it incorrectly or dangerously. Some of the examples of this include pies that expired an hour before I received them, an egg that was completely raw in the middle, and tonights lovely mess up. Tonight I ordered the Angus Mushroom and Swiss. According to the website this should include 2 full slices of swiss cheese and a decent amount of mushrooms. I had about a teaspoon of mushrooms, no sauce, and 1/2 a slice of cheese. That is right, they left off a slice and a half of cheese! In addition, it was a regular (and relatively old) quarter pound patty, not the big ole angus patty they should have used. I have called the number on the receipt multiple times that takes me to the district office. They consistently send out a free sandwich or drink coupon to apologize. They tell me how sorry they are and suggest I try one of their other locations, as this is the only one they receive complaints from. From what I was told they are revamping this store, but I have been told that for well over a year, and it seems to have been unvamped and going down hill, which I didn't think was even possible! I keep vowing this will be my last visit, but then find myself sitting in the drive thru line yet again wondering if I will ever receive my food. I highly do not recommend this location.

My companions followed suit.

One man chewed with his eyes closed. Another bobbed his head up and down. Either he was falling in and out of sleep or agreeing with everything.

       " 'It\\'s 2 for 1 review day! I can\\'t review the Walmart without reviewing the McDonald\\'s that resides inside. And boy is it some tantalizing stuff.I try not to give too many 1-star reviews but this McDonald\\'s so deserves it. I hardly frequent a McDonald\\'s at all (although this is my second McDonald\\'s review in less than a week) but I need to let the peeps in on this one. No Yelper should go unwarned. Of course I came to McDonald\\'s since I have those coupons for their new contraption, the McWrap. Which when I pronounce very fast and in my Scottish accent sounds much like \\'McCrap\\'. After my second go round with this thing, I have made up my mind it is decidedly so. I need to write McDonald\\'s execs to change the name on this thing immediately.My coupon for the day was buy a medium fries and a medium drink, get a McWrap of your choice for FREE. I have a hard time resisting free. I\\'m here to tell you...WORST ALMOST FREE MEAL OF MY LIFE!!! Seriously.It was the tail end of lunchtime so the line was still a bit busy. I patiently waited for almost 10 minutes...which is like forever in McDonald\\'s time. At least two folks left the line while I was there. I know it\\'s not McDonald\\'s fault, but the couple in front of me took up majority of the line space because they were in motorized wheelchairs. And they were very loud. This doesn\\'t bother me much. But...they were also very stinky. Yes, stinky. I have no problem with stinky in most cases (I occasionally help the homeless so I know) but the guy in front of me hadn\\'t washed in DAYS if I were to guess. To each his own, and I know it\\'s almost summer so I know we all want to save water...but DAMN. If I get a whiff and I have to take a step back? You might be S-T-I-N-K-Y. But who am I to judge? I took a big step back and waited my turn. Free is the motivation here. I finally get up there to the McDonald\\'s cashier and present my coupon to the guy. He takes a look at it and says \\'We don\\'t usually take the promo coupons at this location but we\\'ll let you use it.\" Then he proceeds to put the coupon onto a stack of...more coupons! Mind boggling to say the least. He takes my order of a medium fries and medium drink, asks me what type of McWrap I want (Grilled Chicken & Bacon) and rings me up. $2.91 later I\\'m given my receipt and asked to wait for my number to be called.I wait. And wait. #1! #2! #3! #5! #6! #7! #8! Obviously I\\'m #4 and 10 minutes later I am still waiting. Honestly, what the Hell are you guys doing back there? Mixing the masa for my fresh pressed tortilla? Feathering a chicken? Perhaps ripening a tomato? I ask the McDonald\\'s runner and he tells me, \"We\\'re waiting for your McWrap.\" Of course.At this point I\\'m almost running late to be back at work, so the minute I get my order I bolt back to the office and have lunch at my desk. Thankfully I\\'m only three minutes away. I really, really should have just gone to the vending machine or eaten my stash of Reese\\'s chocolate peanut butter eggs from last Easter. Talk about disappointment! I take out my McWrap from my bag and lay down the box of fries on my desk. I continue working while munching away on what is supposed to be McDonald\\'s claim to fame. Their golden fries. I bite into one, eh a bit stale. I bit into another one, eh not enough salt. I bite into yet another one, eh cold?? I look down, and whaddaya know? My damn fry is not even barely cooked! White like Olivia Wilde in the winter. I look through the entire box and find at least half a dozen fries not cooked properly! Not golden brown! Not delicious! Barely out of their frozen state, and just limp. Not acceptable! Please check my pic for proof of this travesty. McDonald\\'s not doing their fries right is like IKEA not serving their Swedish Meatballs with gravy. NO BUENO.After getting over this somewhat I finally hit my stride to go on to my Grilled Chicken & Bacon McWrap. Wow, talk about lightning striking twice. This thing was lifeless! After unwrapping this beast (the box is still the best part about this McWrap), I could just tell something was off. Tortilla was already showing signs of being soggy way too long. The chicken peeking out of the top was not looking tip top shape either. After some hesitation, I took a bite. UGH I say, UGH! Freshness was not part of the gameplan for this McDonald\\'s today. All cold and soggy! And upon all, my McWrap wasn\\'t built correctly! Instead of having Spring Mix like it\\'s supposed to, there was plain old shredded iceberg lettuce! And my bacon was missing! In the words of our Lord Darth Vader....NOOOOOOOO! It was McCrap through & through. Totally upset over this one. I have picture proof of this travesty of gourmet eats as well. McDonald\\'s you have pissed off the wrong fatty. I will definitely be calling your hotline to complain about this one for sure. Knowing my luck I\\'ll get a coupon for a free McWrap. CRAP.',\n",

I am under the impression that it was recently refurbished. The interior shows off McDonald's history through portraits of the first McDonald's. The booths are extraordinary comfortable for a McDonald's. Disparate from a few Las Vegas Valley Walmart McDonald's, this location offers more breakfast items. Including the egg McMuffin. On my visit, they served me the egg McMahon meal in a short period of time. The coffee was hot. And I left satisfied. Keep in mind that I ate here around 9:45 AM, before the Saturday morning rush.

Yes, there are times that the food comes out hot. It\\'s one of the reasons I keep going back. There\\'s nothing like hot Fry\\'s from McDonalds.. and also, just because it\\'s McDonald\\'s. Like it or not, it\\'s a staple for working parents too tired to cook dinner after work some nights. It is unfortunate that they have no competition in the immediate area to keep them on their toes, otherwise they might actually try to improve their service and their product.

The register guy did come out to sweep and while he did try his best I have to wonder why he choose to move the chairs at my table and sweep below my feet (remember that it was the only clean table in the store) and ignore what I'm only guessing was a hunk of apple on the floor at the table across from me or the fry and salt residue on the seats of the same table?

I wanted the new habanero ranch, couldn't even taste the sauce except for one bite! Plus it was luke-warm at least twice! The hot & spicy with a tiny splash of mayo? I mean, really! I ordered an iced Caramel Mocha, get to the window, she hands me the latte, it had no caramel on the whip, so I ask, is this the Caramel Mocha? She stares at me blankly and says yes, I say, I'm used to it having caramel on top, she says its a caramel mocha, so off to work I go, I'm already late because they are super SLOW, and sure enough take a sip after I'm gone and it's a regular mocha. Pathetic service!I did write in to corporate after my 8th or 10th attempt to do business there.. And the manager called me and apologized. Told me to come in and get a free combo on him. So not happening. Go in so they can remember me as the Girl who called them out for their shit slow service, always messing up my orders, and crap food making? No thanks.

That would've been useful info to have when he first asked! So I ended up with Oreo. He comes back and I take a bite of my McFlurry. For those who may not know a McFlurry is soft serve icecream mixed with whatever topping you get. How do you possibly mess that up? Messing up a McFlurry is equal to the stupidity of burning cornflakes! There is no excuse. I took one bite and threw it away. The icecream was warm and the oreo chucks were stale. NASTY!

The only had oatmeal raisin which I can only describe is the asshole of cookies. So literally they have no good desserts. So my poor baby goes without what he wants.

That place is hardcore.Food = OK. Service = OK. Fast and efficient as a colonoscopy. Really nothing of greatness at this McDonald's. Really run of the mill. We often visit this location if we are staying in the nearby Red Rock Casino. Although I would suppose this location stays steadily busy is in part because of the tourists that stay at the Red Rock as well and want cheap eats while on vacation. Gotta make up for all those lost wages!Newest thing at McDonald's is their health-conscious Egg White 'Delight' McMuffin. Definitely a healthier take on their breakfast menu. And yes, I fell for that damn $1 coupon conveniently stuck to my McDonald's bag and tried one. Myself being a bit of a health nut can't complain. This egg white creation is pretty tasty. Grilled egg whites, Canadian bacon (eh?), and white cheddar all on a toasted English muffin? All for only 250 calories? Yeah for a dollar I really liked it. But at the regular price of almost $3? I would have probably passed. With coupon for $1 and a $1 coffee it made for a nice meal on the small scale of economy. I almost, ALMOST, added a $1 hash brown. Luckily I passed and decided to save my money & calories for later.Other than that, I think majority of people around the world know what McDonald's offers on their menu. If you don't, dang, you must be living under a rock? Or possibly a place where there is no McDonald's within your vicinity (like under a rock).\",\n",

I was the only person in the drive thru so I pulled right up to the menuI waited for someone to take my order at the speaker but no one said anythingFinally an employee with an headset walked out of the back room of McdonaldsI figured this was because the order speaker was broken or somethingBut no, the employee walked over and flipped the menu from breakfast to lunchtimeI was thinking in my head .... whaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?Keep in mind, my car is right there, I\\'m obviously waiting to order.Then the employee turned around and walked back into McDonaldsThen someone started taking my order over the speakerI ordered my breakfast items. which they informed me they were no longer serving. I was thinking in my mind \"do you not think I just saw you walk out and turn the menu, I mean my car was like 2 feet away from you\"Anyway, I was craving breakfast, so I let them know I wanted to cancel my orderI was told the breakfast hours were overThen ... magically ... like a Christmas Miracle, they had breakfast for me.Truth is I was willing to leave McDonalds with out my breakfast food. I have a rule for myself. I never fight with people that make my food behind closed doors. Yea, maybe paranoid but sadly its a reality. So I was completely polite about canceling my order. I do believe they did the right thing by offering me these breakfast items. Where i find the problem is the simple lack of customer service. That conversation of them no longer serving breakfast was one we should have never had. Implying that my order was an inconvenience when clearly It shouldn\\'t have been. So then, i went back a few days later (because I\\'m the type that gives second chances) and they missed a few items that I had ordered. Meaning I ordered them, saw it on the drive thru order menu screen, paid for it and it wasn\\'t in my bag when they gave me my order.Yea, this is a long review, I would honestly be surprised if someone read down this far. Props to you if you have. But the whole reason behind it is that I am just super tired of getting terrible customer service and paying for food that I don\\'t get.

The Blue Diamond Road landscape seems to change every week. New to the landscape is the old familiar Golden Arches sign. After hiking for six hours I was exhausted and needed a snack. Lately my opinion of McDonald's is that it does a better job of filling the void for a light meal, snack, Frape Mocha, or coffee if a coffee shop is not around. To temporarily hold over my appetite and enjoy a beverage besides water that I had been drinking all the day on the hike, I ordered the $1 large Coke and $1 hot & spicy. Being a new McDonalds this location is modern and for now immacuately clean. First off it is a nice first impression when a McDonald's is not part of a gas station, like the one down the road at Blue Diamond and Rainbow. I entered through modern electric sliding doors. There were two managers, and I got a nice greeting. The workers were on top of their game. There were plenty of booths to choose from. The interior is more contemporary than McDonald Land. The McDonald Playland is nonexistent. What does exist is a chandelier and a more elegant lobby. They did not go modern to the point of some restaurants that feature the super Coke machines with a 100 plus flavors. The typical Coke flavors they had were not flat. McDonald's may not be 4 star dining. However, when I just want a snack to fill me up or a Frape Caramel; McDonald's gets the job done. The Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge. Review 88.\",\n",

       " 'Every time that I go to the welcome screen on Yelp, I keep seeing \"Your next review awaits\" with a picture of Ronald McDonald patting a man I don\\'t know. Yelp wants me to write the review and I am tired of seeing this when I go on the welcome screen. So, I will write a review on the McDonald\\'s in Sam\\'s Town. When I write a review I try to look at a unique aspect of the business. When it comes to fast food restaurants, it takes some thinking. What makes this McDonald\\'s unique is that it features the exact Western motif displayed throughout Sam\\'s Town. It is incorporated in a food court in back of the mountain where the robotic Mystic Falls robotic animals perform. I don\\'t know of any McDonald\\'s where I could grab a Big Mac and fries and watch a robotic cast of animals performing in a laser show, What also makes this McDonald;s unique for a location off the Strip is that they do not honor the $1 Any Size Beverage promotion. The Sam\\'s Town McDonald\\'s is one of a few food choices in Sam\\'s Town. In my opinion I pass over their coffee and dessert for Dunkin Donuts. I pass over their lunch and dinner menu for the Firelight Buffet, Panda Express, and Subway. For my tastes, this McDonald\\'s is advantageous for a light snack or a Large Coke for the drive home. The time I spend on the line justifies a check-in. It is the McDonald\\'s of Sam\\'s Town, and it gets busy. In comparison to a similar McDonald\\'s in the D casino, the employees are friendly. This summarizes my experiences for the Sam\\'s Town McDonald\\'s. Yelp should be happy that I wrote the review, and I should be happy to see a new picture on my welcome screen.',\n",

Unfortunately, this means that at night, during games and practices, the parking lot is mostly full due to people parking there for their games.Do not let the parking lot fool you if there is a game in progress. It's probably not very packed at all.Another thing relates to the free wifi. They have the power outlets inside ONLY under a large HD tv where they have 4 comfortable chairs set up. This tells me they only want people using the internet over there and not at the tables, keeping the tables open. From a business perspective, this is smart.

I was too hungry too, so I just ate them both, but felt my heart clogging up for the rest of the afternoon.My order did show up correct on the order confirmation screen in the Drive-Thru window, and the order did print up correctly on my receipt, but the totally incorrect product turned up in my bag unfortunately.

I uploaded that photo here at the time of this review but it was originally taken early in the year (mainly because I had another bad experience and I need to tell everyone not to come here any more because they suck.)So the first time, as the photo shows, a dead small black fly on the lettuce in my Classic Crispy Chicken Sandwich. I usually order it without mayo and when I got my sandwich the 1st time, guess what? It had mayo. I just don\\'t get why they can\\'t read instructions properly or anything. Why can\\'t the condiment be separate and not default? It\\'s so frustrating. Any way, 2nd time I got the sandwich, they \"got it right\" except for the fly part. I already went in my car so I said \"F it\" so I just took the picture as proof and then ripped the contaminated area on the lettuce.I didn\\'t go to this location for awhile after this incident, but I was craving Chicken McNuggets and so since it isn\\'t a fresh produce item or whatever, I decided it wouldn\\'t be a big deal. Boy was I wrong. I think this might have happened twice but I counted my nuggets and it was missing 1 in the 10 or 20 piece meal. I shouldn\\'t have to count how many nuggets I have, but sadly these people can\\'t do their job. I don\\'t even get much time to eat lunch so I didn\\'t have time to go back and complain. I\\'m done with this location any way so if I\\'m craving a sandwich or Chicken McNuggets from here, I\\'ll just drive across the bridge and go there because it probably isn\\'t crap like this location. They know they are serving a ton of people since they are the only location but they just do such a bad job. The fries are a bit overpriced too and some other things in case any of you were thinking you can get a decent deal on Large Fries. The best place for that would be the Beaverton location near Uwajimaya off highway 10 (I think that\\'s it.)Conclusion: If you crave McDonalds, don \\'t go to this location unless you want dead flies in your burgers/sandwiches or missing Chicken McNuggets.',\n",

No play structure though so if you come here so your kids can play you are out of luck.This store has new management, but I have notice no major changes since they took over a few weeks back.The only negative thing I have is they don\\'t wear gloves when making the food.

In addition to the incorrect order, if you order a large fry you can expect about as many fries as come in a small size. Always feel ripped off. I paid for a large not a small in a large container.

The burger was ice cold and I asked for another one, the girl took it back and returned a burger to me within 30 seconds. She did not wash her hands at all. There was a clump of hair in it. There were no hairnets on any employee. I spoke with the \"manager\" Sean, and Sean decided to leave before I was done with my statement because I asked the manager if not having hairnets, having facial piercings and taking a cup back after a customer has handled it and putting it back in the cup dispenser was a common practice at McDonalds, Sean told me \"Go ahead, call the fucking health department asshole I don\\'t care!\" My wife and I have had upset stomachs since we got home (we were only there 20 minutes and live 15 minutes away)',\n",

They must be animal rights activists that run this establishment. I asked the young girl at the counter what their speciality was and she told me the Big Mac was one of their finer dishes. I placed the order along with some French fries, I no longer call them freedom fries now that the French have come fully on board with our war against Muslim countries #jesuischarlie I wonder how these French fries will be served, I am imagining they will be garnished with black truffles . I ask for their wine list and am told they do not have one. How peculiar for a restaurant that serves French food. To my horror no baguettes either. My food bill comes to 6.30 cents. Imagine that, the Big Mac meal , their finest offering and it is only just over 6 dollars. The wait is not long for my entree, so glad I did not ask for their freedom onion soup. Strangely the food is in a box and a carton. This must be a new style , the creativity of chefs these days knows no bounds. I am impressed. I open up the box and there lies this lettucey thing with some kind of salad dressing on it. It is cold and damp. This must be an artistic statement of some kind. Possibly a commentary on the ill treatment of the Intuit natives at the turn of the last century. I am impressed by the chefs social concerns but I had wished that the food was hot. I took a bite . I am glad that I sat close to the toilet as I made a run for it. They must have been upset that I ordered the foie gras originally. They are making me pay for it. I know when I have been defeated. My pomme frites were hot but lacking any French accoutrements. This must be French cooking under the Vichy government when the Germans took away their cream and tried to make them eat sausages.

I honestly think Chicago PD needs to have a few officers staffed inside this place 24/7, since there are always a lot of sketchy things going on. I'm surprised no one has been stabbed and/or shot.Even if you are just passing by, you will immediately know something is up with this place. There are no less than 20 strange characters loitering outside of it pretty much all day, making weird comments at strangers. Again, it's nothing short of a miracle that people haven't been stabbed or shot here. I make it a point to walk past as quickly as possible and not make eye contact since the people loitering out front always give me weird looks and act like they want to fight.Seriously, if this place got bulldozed tomorrow morning I don't think anyone would shed a tear and the adjacent buildings' property values would quadruple. Businesses like this are the reason Yelp needs negative stars.Also, I LOL'd at the photos making this look like a classy place. It is not.\",\n",

Or, he/she is friends with all of them and they all do whatever they want. I'm pretty sure the cashier made plans with the guy in front of me to hook up when her shift was over. The person they had cleaning the dining room was acting as though it was his territory and lining up chairs so that people could not sit where he had cleaned.......except it's open 24 hours. While I was there I could have a) bought crack b) hired a prostitute c) been beaten up or, d) been robbed at gunpoint. I would not recommend that you visit this establishment.

       " \"I rate this McDonald's 2-3/4 stars. Its a downtown McDonald's at the crossroads of State and Chicago Streets at the entrance to the subway.  One word describes this McDonald's: busy. It seems that this McDonald's is marketed to the commuters exiting the subway and driving on Chicago Street with its giant arches hanging above the subway exit at Chicago Street. The result is that this McDonald's is busy. Even outside there are usually people hanging out, including the homeless. This Mcdonald's is relatively large. There was no problem getting a table. And there was breathing room. Because this McDonald's is busy and the employees were overworked while being on the friendly side, I will not dwell on the fact that they forgot my order and napkins. I will just knock off half a star. This McDonald's is convenient, and relatively inexpensive. Whether its one or five stars, the convenience and ample seating makes up for the flaws. Closing up this review, I have two tips. If you are not in a rush, I recommend the cool Rock & Roll McDonald's.

It would have taken someone 15 seconds to pull some ice cream out of the soft serve into a cone and then I would have been out of that mob. While I was in the mob waiting to be served, they called out a # for two ice cream cones OVER AND OVER again. Obviously those people had been waiting so long and were so frustrated that they left and didn't care about the dollar they threw down for the cones. Pathetic.

Name another thing sold anywhere at a franchise where the price can vary so wildly.

Not even me, a McDonald's-hating hippie.2) Complete chaos at the ordering station, even with very little line.3) Pigeons being fed in the outdoor seating area - by an employee - who alternated from cursing at the pigeons to (when they got too close to her) throwing fries to get them to get away.

       " \"Today was the breaking point. Long ago, McDonald's revolutionized the restaurant industry with fast food dining, a paragon of what was possible when human ingenuity applied itself to streamline processes and deliver maximum production and food for people in the least amount of time. These days, efficiency no longer matters and has been replaced with indifference, complacency, and a lack of disregard to customer priorities. On most mornings, I will stop into McDonald's to grab a yogurt parfait for $1.12 as my morning breakfast. I did it because it was a healthy breakfast, tasted good, and was amazingly cheap. Before today, one of the top ten things I associate with McDonald's is efficiency, and today I can throw that word out the window because McDonald's no longer merits it.Today I left my house early for the express purpose of ordering more food for breakfast because I didn't have dinner and I was short on sleep and needed a giant coffee to go with some food to keep me sane for a long day at work. I arrived at 8:44am and I know this because Foursquare told me so when I checked in! Something was amiss and there was a large crowd of people and lines that were simply not moving.Great, these things sometimes happen, which was why I was glad that I left my house early so that if I actually did have to wait in line it wouldn't matter and I'd still be able to get what I wanted when I wanted it. The minutes started flying by and the line still wasn't moving! What happened to that proud tradition of corporate efficiency to deliver the customer what they wanted when they wanted with the highest degree of professionalism and courtesy? Well you can all forget about it because it's clear that no one in this McDonald's during the morning shift gives one iota of care for anyone waiting in line.I got to be the third person in line when two customers started to argue with the cashier that they wanted cream on the side of their coffee and not mixed in. The clerk wouldn't make a new coffee for the customers and the customers weren't having any of it. Watching these people argue with the clerk got my blood boiling because I was trying to get an order in and get to work on time! Because of the inability of the clerk to placate these customers I ended up stuck in line waiting, waiting, and waiting in what seemed to be forever!Having arrived at 8:44am, it was now 8:54am and I hadn't made an order! I yelled in frustration about the utter lack of disregard the staff had much to the amusement of the other patrons who were all either waiting for their order or waiting to order who all were in the same boat. I slammed the door on leaving and walked a block over to Starbucks. At Starbucks I spent $5 for a giant cup of coffee and no food - $5 I could have easily spent at McDonald's in order to get what I wanted, but apparently McDonald's no longer cares about earning my money since they are too busy arguing with other customers and making everyone wait to order and wait for their food. Long gone are the good old days of the quick food restaurant, this McDonald's no longer adheres to any sense of time or service and has degenerated into the ultimate display of incompetency.

The only thing fresh in this place is what will be on the toilette paper the next day as a result of the oil that, I imagine, was obtained from an underworld market exchange fashioned by cheap costs and the flesh of missing persons. Of course, some may say that I inflate the truth; consequently, that\\'s how you feel when you pay money for something at a place that cheats you out of more than simply the so-called \"food.\" Well--find out for yourself, or continue reading the content which others wrote here to save yourself a hospital bill and walking off 6 pounds to get your car back.

Now for the bad news: high volume McDonalds have been trying different line workflows for the last six months, at least at this location and the one in Union Station, and with the recent automation implemented you can expect to wait 10 minutes for a cup of coffee. As another review said, it's probably because it does seem like chaos to stand in a line 2-3 deep, place your order, and then step aside in front of the people who ordered before you, so the person fulfilling the order can shuttle to the counter & back delivering your bag of food. This actually got you your food pretty quickly, even in peak times.So now the newest system is a single register to take orders, and an electronic system that shows order numbers that are ready on a TV screen. Sounds great, right? Not at this location. For some reason their fulfillment process is very very slow. It took 10 minutes the other day for my order to come up, and with the old system, it would be 2-3 minutes consistently, I think it was faster because there were four individual teams working on fulfilling orders, not a centralized mainly single-threaded process with the new system.This morning I walked in, saw the line in front of the register was 2 deep, and 20 people were waiting for their orders (20!). This isn't DeKalb where a busload of people just walked in. It's McDonalds, and they clearly need to to fix something with this store / their new process, or just change back to the old chaotic system that got you your food in 2-3 minutes consistently.\",\n",

Multiple times I have had to get someone's attention and remind them that I am still waiting to place my order.It's not rocket science. Heck, it's not even science. It's service. Plain and simple. Divide and conquer: one group of people take orders and another group of people run the food while yet another makes it in the back. Sounds simple, right? Well it doesn't appear so simple when you walk into this McDonald's.I have worked in the food service industry as a waiter and I understand that people have different ideas on what is good service but one thing is always constant: greet your customer and communicate with them. Let them know if you'll be a minute; inform them if there's a wait. Whatever the issue just let them know; they'll appreciate you more for it and be more willing and patient to wait.Other than the service this is, well, McDonald's. Doesn't matter which one you go to you get pretty much the same thing. That's the hallmark of their business. The only difference is service.So, pay attention franchisees: McDonald's may continue to get my money but you independent franchise owners may soon lose valuable customers with poor service.Afterall, there's a McDonald's within a couple miles just about anywhere in developed countries.\",\n",

As a rebellious child growing up, eat at a Mcdonald's was luxury. The closest place without a car had to be in McKinley Park. Fast forward a few years and the McDonald's express opened. Despite it being fastfood, it poses as a treat to all the locals in the neighborhood; after playing sports at Mcguane or just grabbing a quick bite. This Mcdonald's is very small compared to other Mcdonalds, but they do serve most items. Since they marketed their $1 menu couple of years ago, the dollar menu has never changed. McChickens and Mcdoubles were always a $1. Now with the advertised $1 breakfast menus and any size drink, there are a lot of cheap options. My only grievance is that they don't have sweet tea and salads, but unsweetened tea is available.

All things being fair, the culinary experience was doomed for failure given certain personal and tragic circumstances I won\\'t get into here.Upon stepping to the counter, I gave pause to the abbreviated menu not worthy of a McDonald\\'s Express, which is a new concept to me all-together. I decided to play it safe with the classic cheeseburger meal with an intimidating amount of fries and drink aka \"The Value Meal\". My meal was served up a little too quickly with all due credit to the server. The food seemed to appear from nowhere - gremlins cooking the food? I could see the grease seeping through one of the burger wrappers. At this point I made a snap substitution request, no coke, coffee instead - a hot beverage will make the grease go down smoother. My server obligated me in silence and I acknowledged her generosity. I took my tray and chose a seat by the front windows where parked cars would treat the diner with blinding light from their headlights, but at least it was somewhat devoid of the cold glowing light emitting from the overhead florescent located in the rear of the restaurant.I sat down and emptied the contents of the bag, fries and napkins, no ketchup. I tasted one of the fries to determine if they were worthy of ketchup-free consumption, but alas no, they were slightly cold with a texture that left an unpleasant lump in your throat. I fetched several ketchup packets from the server, kept under tight security behind the counter and returned to my table.Spilling out the ketchup packets on the table, I noticed dried droplets of ketchup on the plastic packets. No turning back now, I dug into my dinner with a overwhelming sadness for humanity and myself. So, to sum up:Fries. They left an odd taste of seafood or fish to my palette. Perhaps they co-mingled food in the fryer. The luke-warm temparture made it a bit difficult to choke them down. Maybe some beer would have helped the process.Cheeseburgers. Lifting the top bun of any burger, you can tell right away if there was any love in the preparation. Though consumable, the burgers were not satisfying and tasted as if they sat under a heat lamp for too long, also lukewarm.Coffee. I have tasted better coffee from a mechanical contraption in a corporate lunch room. It was watery, lukewarm and slightly sweet in a way that amplified everything that went wrong with the coffee.Ketchup Packets. Looks like they were dropped on the floor at some point or recycled from a previous diner that did not use up all their ketchup.Customer Service.

That\\'s Express, people!The only thing that drags this place down is the atmosphere. the counter is tiny and only holds two registers, so at any busy point in time, the line of people engulfs the only walking space and makes its way to the door, and sometimes extends OUT the door, though I\\'ve only seen that during dinner times as I\\'ve passed by on my way home from Unique or something.The soda machine has once or twice been low on syrup, yielding a nasty beverage - but it\\'s outside the counter, so you can refill it with something else on your own. The tables for sitting are VERY close together, meaning it\\'s difficult to eat your food in peace at this location without being bothered by someone\\'s family issues or rampant children. It can get very loud here.But all in all, if you\\'re stopping in for something to go, this is a great place for that.

       " 'So my first experience with this McDonald\\'s was the day that I moved in. I had a couple friends helping me. This McDonald\\'s is directly across the street from my apartment.So, after witnessing a guy smash his van (we later were told by the po-po that it was stolen) into the light pole right at the corner, then watching him exit the vehicle and run maniacly down North Ave., away from the scene, we decided we were hungry. We thought \"why not go to McD\\'s\". Seems logical. I mean, McD\\'s is always the same no matter where you go, right? And it was certainly conveniently located. At least it appears conveniently located. Oh, its not. Attempting to cross North Ave. at my intersection is really a situation where you are taking your life into your hands. This is a 4, 5, 6, oh hell, I don\\'t even know how many corners there are here, intersection. And one of the lights is only green for one side of the street, but has no sign indicating that anywhere, so people either don\\'t stop or just stand there. You feel like you are playing Frogger. Except not with a pixellated frog, but rather with your own skin and organs.If you make it into the building with your spinal cord still attached to your body, you will see they always have at least 15 people working here. Yet, there are never more than 2 registers open at once. And the only people working those registers are either a. ancient, non-english speaking women b. mentally handicapped. Hey, I appreciate their sense of social responsibility to hire the old and degenerate. I do not appreciate the game of charades I must play with the cashiers to get my order right.While you are waiting the 15 plus minutes it takes to get your food here, you may notice that this McDonalds is a bit different from the rest. Ricky Martin pictures, signed Selena CDs and gigantic Enrique Iglesias are the decor of choice here. Apparantly, this is the Latin Rock n\\' Roll McDonalds. Couple that with the fact that its the only McDonald\\'s I have ever seen that has Jalepeno\\'s as a condiment and the fact that they look at me as if I am lost every time I walk in there, I think its safe to say the clientele here is pretty set.Overall, the location, service and neighborhood sucks. I would give it only 1 star, but hey, its open 24-7 and its McDonalds.',\n",
       " 'At a time when people are finally realizing that we must eat healthy to be healthy McDonalds makes no moves away from their overly processed junk food. This McDonalds is focused on cars and its parking lot is twice as big as the restaurant. Go to the La Perla Tapatia which is right next door.',\n",
       " \"Never thought I'd write a review about a McDonald's, but I feel compelled. This one was just re-built, replacing a perfectly servicable old one. Whatever, it's their money.My problem with the new one is that its parking lot configuration and ease of ingress/egress is even more stupid than the old one, if that's possible. You see, if you're coming from the east, entrance into the lot, either via entrances on North Avenue or Lowell (one way north), is no problem. If you're coming from the west on North Avenue (or from the south on Kostner), you literally cannot enter the parking lot. At all. I thought by turning left onto Kostner (a fairly main-drag kind of street), I could enter (as you could with the old one). Nope. No entrance any more on Kostner. And you cannot turn left from North Avenue to Lowell because there's a median (I think: either way, you're risking an accident or a ticket). There's an alley directly behind the lot, which is not only fenced off from Mickey D's, but 'one way' going out. So I drive AROUND THE BLOCK, past Lowell (the one-way street next to McDonald's), to Kildare, back to North Avenue, then enter. Jesus. The entrance has one of those divided-curb thingys, which was barely wide enough for my compact car. There are TWO drive-thru lanes from which to order food, but then they merge into one waiting line, so you can end up in this single line ahead of someone who's been waiting longer, or vice-versa, so why bother? The rest was standard McDonald's (WHY can't you at least offer me salsa for my breakfast burrito?)....I got no sauce, no ketchup, no napkins, nuthin'.OK, then to get out and go back east on North Avenue, you must basically repeat the maze-bullshit from above, only in the reverse. You used to be able to exit onto Kostner, then turn left on North Avenue. Now you are forced to either go west on Grand or North Avenue or go to Lowell, north to Wabansia (past a high school) to Kildare to North Avenue. Got all that? Apparently the city thinks it's more desirable for us to drive around an entire neighborhood than to use the only (inexplicably) one-way alley in the entire neighborhood to get home from fucking McDonald's. I felt like rat in a ghetto-maze, only with a soon-to-be-cold Egg McMuffin.So in a nutshell, if you live west of here, you can't get in. If you live east of here, you can't get out. And ya can't really go north, either. It's maddening. If you must go to THIS McDonald's, walk or take the bus, seriously. From my house (at the halfway point between the two), I will just go down to the one at Kedzie/North. I realize McDonald's and/or the city are trying to protect themselves from lawsuits from our shitty driving, and that badly designed intersection, but if it's that dangerous (which it is) then just DON'T BUILD IT THERE. It's a square lot, yet needlessly complicated. Grrr.\",\n",

Oh no, we're talking about gross deficiencies in cooking/prep or we're talking about forgetting a cheeseburger or (as happened to me yesterday) leaving out an entire pack of chicken nuggets and the sauce.

I'd rather the place be run by cold fascists and get my order right.I live a few blocks away, but have no plans to go back.

Every time I pull in to this place it seems quicker to head inside rather than sit in their slowly creeping drive through only to find out upon arriving home they failed to include an item in my order.

Needless to say my daughter is a slow eater so we were there for at least a 1/2 hour and never saw anyone come and clean tables. The food was horrible and not by McDonald's standards, but by human consumption standards.  The nuggets were cold the second we opened the bag.  The burger was cold and the bun was stale.  The french fries were cold and looked like they were sitting around for awhile. There was so much salt on the fries that I actually had to throw them away.  I love McDonald's french fries, but not when made here. I should have learned my lesson the first time I went to this place and the nuggets were cold last time.

I went inside to order and each time took 10 to 20 minutes to get my order. 2 out of the 3 times other customers complained because the staff forgot something where they had the wrong order, missing items or also waited more than 10 minutes. I can imagine that these kind of errors would happen if the restaurant was extremely busy but by looking at the people inside and the drive thru outside...the place was not busy so do they give poor service every time I go there? The last time I told the manager that I've been waiting over 10 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers fries and a coke so why does it take over 10 minutes to get my order? She threw my fries back and gave me new ones and then I waited another 5 minutes to get the cheeseburgers. BAD PLACE.

       " \"When I think of McDonald's, I generally think of a pretty tightly ran ship and expediency.Something is horribly wrong with this Mcdonalds. Severely long wait times at the drive thru. A couple weeks ago they weren't even taking orders via the intercom. You literally had to wait your turn to get to the 2nd window before placing your order, then they had you wait right there at the window until they fulfilled the order. Do you know what this does to business?! Cars were driving off without completing their orders.I just now attempted to go through just for a coffee. Few cars in line but again...loooonnnng wait time. I finally got to the intercom and before I could even place my coffee order, the woman blurts out that they don't currently have any fries.Seriously?! This is flippin McDonald's?I placed my coffee order then started the long wait. After a few minutes and no movement of the cars ahead, I pulled on out of there and went across the street to the whopper king. I do believe from what I have seen going on there over the past couple of months, that unless there is a corporate intervention...and soon...this place is a sinking ship with no life boats.\",\n",
       " \"Location is in a improving neighborhood near the Cleveland Clinic. It is open 24 hrs. Service is generally good and friendly. Fare is basic McD's. Good choice if you need a fast food fix in the neighborhood.\",\n",

       " \"The expectations aren't high for food. And they stayed there besides the fries. The standard quarter pounder meal was every bit standard fair.  The dollar menu tastes about the same here. The service is very quick. That is from lots of workers and food waiting for you to get here.  They work their food forecasts really well, but I'd wait a couple minutes for hour food. But hey att last they can make really good sweet tea here!  There is a lot of better places surrounding this place.\",\n",

Be sure to carefully go through your order once you receive it, I've received wrong or incomplete orders many times. We also noticed very salty hamburger patties a couple times.Unless you're desperate for some McDonalds go elsewhere. On the other hand; if you're trying to kick your Micky Dee's habit the experience you'll routinely receive at this restaurant may help you do it.The only reason I'm not giving them a one star review is because I know I will probably eat there again - it's the only McDonalds option near my home.\",\n",

       " 'Taking the \"fast\" out of fast food...THE UP-SIDE: Once in a while, we all eat at McDonalds. This one happens to be very clean and nearly \"nice\" on the inside. However...THE DOWN-SIDE: I\\'ve gone to this location several times over the past two years. Each time, I went through the drive-through and had to endure a wait of over 10 minutes. I literally waited 15 minutes in line on two different ocassions. So, just today when I visited, I thought, \"Hmm. I\\'ll be smart this time. I\\'ll go inside to beat the line drive-through line wrapping around the building.\" Well, I should have known better. Inside, the line snaked to the door; just two feet from where I entered the restaurant. They had one woman on the register and she was moving at a snail\\'s pace.I waited for a full 10 minutes - yes, I\\'m an idiot - and still hadn\\'t even gotten to place my order. In fact, there were still five people in front of me! Frustrated and hating myself for giving this place yet another shot, I left without food and vowed NEVER TO RETURN.THE SUM-IT-UP: I really don\\'t like McDonalds that much, but I do think that they seem pretty well-run overall. However, this particular location is an anomoly. It\\'s just downright horrid in it\\'s customer service and nobody - I mean nobody - should ever stop here for \"fast\" food. This place is terrible.',\n",
       " 'Not as good as other locations. Prices are higher just because it is in the mall. They also do not have a value menu. The food is the same. The staff are not as friendly.',\n",
       " \"Much rather go to the one in North Ridgeville, because of 1. the location and 2. the hours.North Olmsted McD's is closes at like 10PM and North Ridgeville never closes, so that means when I'm craving a double cheeseburger at 2AM I can drive my little neon to go get one.\",\n",

       " 'They recently gave this location a renovation and updated it. It looks really nice and now has an indoor play area for the kiddos. It\\'s super clean inside (at least when I went) though we actually had to ask someone where the trashcan was since it was hidden around a corner. Ketchup dispenser was broken and they gave me sweet and sour sauce instead of sweet chili like I asked. Now, I usually don\\'t review fast food since it\\'s pretty much the same no matter where you go, but this is the location closest to my house, and I can honestly say I rarely ever go because of one thing...they are SLOOWWWWWW! In the drive through, expect to wait around 10+ minutes. I even had two people behind me decide to leave after they had ordered, and I wasn\\'t the one holding up the line! I ordered a Spicy McChicken and nuggets. I even considered if going inside would have been faster. Bottom line: this isn\\'t the place to go if you want \"fast.\"',\n",
       " 'The drive thru was very slow and the staff was rude. Seriously, who has to wait for almost 15 minutes in the drive thru for two meals? Even as the attendant opened the window to tell us to pull forward she was yelling at her coworkers. Not impressed.',\n",
       " 'This review is based on the poor service I received in the drive thru last night. I have nothing to say about the food because it\\'s McDonald\\'s... I had a horrible headache and a long drive back from The Woodlands so I just decided to swing through the drive thru to grab some food hoping it would help my headache. There were two cars in front of me when I pulled into the line. One car was at the pick up window, the other was at the intercom to order. It didn\\'t take long for the car in front of me to order. When it was my turn, I literally sat there for 3 minutes without anyone acknowledging me. Usually if the employees are slow, they will at least say hello and then ask for a moment to help other customers. I was about to yell into the intercom to make sure they were in fact open. People were pulling up behind me and I was losing my patience. Finally some lady came on the intercom and said \"What can I get you?\" As if they were the ones waiting on me to decide. I could hear a lot of noise in the background (sounded chaotic). I asked for a grilled chicken wrap. She responded with \"We don\\'t have grilled meat, wait yeah ok grilled what else?\" Then I asked for Sprite. \"We\\'re out of Sprite.\" Ok please give me unsweet ice tea. \"OK Sweet tea.\" At that point, my headache was so bad I didn\\'t even try to ask for the frickin unsweet tea. Then she told me to drive forward without telling me a total. As I\\'m waiting to pay and get my food, I see at least two cars leave the drive thru line because they\\'re fed up with the poor service. When I got to the window, the lady even made a comment about it \"Ooooh look at all those cars leaving.\" I\\'m sorry, but if you are aware that you are losing customers, maybe you should step it up a little bit and get your shit together so you don\\'t lose customers. She couldn\\'t have cared less. It was pathetic.Luckily I don\\'t live in that area, so I\\'m hoping to never have to experience such slow, horrible service in a drive thru. This was by far, one of the worst experiences I\\'ve ever had.',\n",

       " \"Sooo I was in a rush and stopped here before work. I ordered a sausage mcgriddle with egg whites and ended up with a nasty, dry sausage biscuit with cheese. It was in a huge, crumpled bag so the thought crossed my mind that it was returned by somebody...maybe? The parking lot is impossible to get through with people driving the wrong way so I didn't bother driving back. Anyway, super annoying when you're on a schedule. Good thing I left some bananas on my desk because I can't eat this.Oh and the other two times I stopped in for coffee the machine was broken. They charge almost as much as Starbucks for a latte that tastes like it was made from a powdered mix and the machine is always down....seriously.\",\n",

       " \"This location is about average as far as McDonald's goes. Their playground tends to be closed often, due to broken equipment (or most recently, broken doors leading to the playground), so if you're planning on taking a group of young children you might want to check ahead of time to make sure the playground is available. I do like the fact that it's one of the few in the area that still have an outdoor playground, but the lack of cover for outdoor tables makes eating outdoors rather unpleasant. All in all, it's okay, and the convenient location in the neighborhood makes it a regular stop. Unfortunately, some of the employees are more interested in chatting with one another than serving customers, and if you have a group of people paying separately but eating together there is an annoying tendency to refuse to take your orders at the same time - meaning the first person's food is cold by the time the last person is served.Edit: I ate at Spicy McChicken Sandwich from the Value Menu around 8pm on 5/17/09 and within hours was doubled over with food poisoning. I can't say that it came from the sandwich, or course, but I can provide this information and let others draw their own logical conclusions.\",\n",

I'm sure how you address these issues without completely remodeling the restaurant to re-orient the driveway and open up a double-driveway.I was here the other day for a Redbox movie and got a drink---the staff is normally pretty courteous but that drive-thru issue really brings down their rating in my mind.\",\n",

I have NEVER gotten an order right here nor even decent quality of service/food. Granted it is in a good location near the reliant and all...but omg, food is gross, drinks are gross (coffee is watered down, flat soda, not very sweet ''sweet tea''), and horrible service both inside and drive thru.

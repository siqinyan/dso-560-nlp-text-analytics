      "100.0% Hayden sets up Australia win  Second one-day international, Christchurch Australia 314-6 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 208 (40.4 overs) by 106 runs  Ricky Ponting (53) and Damien Martyn (58) provided the main support for Hayden, who hit two sixes and 12 fours. They eventually totalled 314-6 and the game was as good as over when New Zealand slumped to 73-6 in reply, with Adam Gilchrist taking five catches. Daniel Vettori made a rapid 83 but they were all out for 208 in the 41st over. New Zealand must now win all three remaining matches to take the series, but such a turn-round looked a remote possibility at Jade Stadium. Skipepr Stephen Fleming chose to put Australia in after winning the toss, with former rugby star Jeff Wilson included in the New Zealand team for his first one-day international since March 1993. He was taught a harsh lesson as his six overs cost 57 runs, with only left-arm spinner Vettori (0-31 from 10) able to exercise any measure of control over the Australian batsmen.  Gilchrist was caught behind off Daryl Tuffey from the second ball of the match but Hayden and Ponting set about putting things right with a stand of 99 for the second wicket. Ponting cleared the ropes twice as he raced to 50 off 51 balls, but only added three more before he was run out by Hamish Marshall. By then, Hayden was into his stride and he and Martyn added 133, although it took them 24 overs. Martyn was run out off the final ball of the 41st over, but the final nine cost the Kiwis 82 runs as Australia raised the tempo. Hayden's century came up off 110 balls but he eventually fell to a catch by Wilson off Kyle Mills, leaving Michael Clarke to add 23 off 13 balls and Mike Hussey 32 not out off 20 as the total mounted past 300.  The new ball pairing of Brett Lee and Glenn McGrath made short work of New Zealand's top order, claiming two wickets each - all of them catches behind the wicket by Gilchrist. He claimed another when Andrew Symonds found the edge of Craig McMillan's bat and when Chris Cairns followed for 22, caught by Hayden, the home side were in danger of being embarrassed. Vettori and Brendon McCullum (20) halted their decline by sharing a stand of 62 before McCullum gave a return catch to Symonds, who finished with 3-41. Wilson made 22 in an eighth wicket stand of 62 but the end came quickly once he was caught by Ponting off Jason Gillespie. Having passed fifty for the first time in a limited overs international, Vettori was denied a century when he was caught at deep square leg off Gillespie after hitting 10 fours in his 77-ball knock. Mills was last to go, run out by Clarke, after setting off for a quick single and being sent back by Tuffey.  S P Fleming, N J Astle, M S Sinclair, J Wilson, C D McMillan, H J H Marshall, C L Cairns, B B McCullum, K D Mills, D L Vettori, D R Tuffey  M L Hayden, A C Gilchrist, R T Ponting, D R Martyn, A Symonds, M J Clarke, M E K Hussey, G B Hogg, B Lee, J Gillespie, G D McGrath \n",

      "100.0% New Zealand to step up security  New Zealand cricket officials are to review security after Australia players were hit by missiles during Saturday's opening one-day international.  The match was stopped several times after Australian fielders complained they had been hit by plastic bottles. New Zealand Cricket chief executive Martin Snedden labelled the missile throwing \"unacceptable\". \"It wasn't the number of security guards, it was the fact they needed to be more proactive,\" he said. Australia captain Ricky Ponting complained immediately after his side's 10-run win. \"Someone's going to get hurt. You have to have more security guys around the players on the boundary,\" he said. However, Kiwi coach John Bracewell accused Australia of using the crowd as a delaying tactic.  He claimed the missile-throwing was no different to the treatment his players got in Australia. Former Australia skipper Steve Waugh threatened to take his players off the field after similar crowd disturbances in New Zealand five years ago. \"I think the tactical awareness as learned by Steve Waugh has been passed on,\" Bracewell said. Despite being hit by a missile at one point, Aussie bowler Glenn McGrath was the star of the show, returning figures of 4-16. \"Glenn was outstanding and we just did enough to win,\" Ponting said. \"It's a very hard place to win over here and we found that out tonight.\" New Zealand skipper Stephen Fleming praised Hamish Marshall, whose 76 almost rescued the match. \"We were out of it, came back really well - Hamish was outstanding - but we just lost our way towards the end.\" \n",

      "96.3% All Black magic: New Zealand rugby  Playing colours:  All black  The Haka and more!  The All Blacks  Charles John Munro discovered rugby at London's Christ College, and on his return to Nelson he staged New Zealand's first game. Nelson Town met Nelson College on 14 May, 1870, the Town triumphing by two goals to nil, instigating a game that would become a national obsession and come to dominate the country's sporting passions. The game appealed to the Kiwi psyche and quickly spread, the native Maoris finding a particular empathy with the sport's warrior ethos. In 1888 a British team led by AE Stoddart toured New Zealand and Australia, and soon after a Maori named Joe Warbrick and an English ex-pat called Thomas Eyton decided to gather a combined New Zealand team.  Twenty-two Maori and four 'pakiha' formed the 'New Zealand Native Team,' who played a total of 107 matches in New Zealand, Australia and the UK. The integration of white and Maori was a reflecion of enlightened New Zealand rugby and society, even if the British press were somewhat mystified by the pre-match tradition of the Maori war dance, the Haka! The other great symbol of New Zealand rugby, the all black kit with the silver fern on the breast, was proposed by Tom Ellison at the first annual meeting of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union in 1893. New Zealand played their first international against Australia in 1903, the Kiwis triumphing 22-3 in Sydney, and the following year an official British touring team came to New Zealand for the first time. The tourists had gone through Australia undefeated but their captain, David Revell Bedell-Sivright, created animosity in New Zealand with his patronising attitude. The Kiwis shocked the rugby world with a 9-3 triumph in Wellington, sparking great celebrations across the country, but Bedell-Sivright churlishly suggested that the victors would have no chance when they visited the UK.  Their opportunity to prove him wrong came in 1905 with the first official New Zealand tour to Europe. The tourists won their early games with a quick-thinking, inventive approach, but press criticism began to grow over their 2-3-2 scrum formation that left a 'roving' forward free to disrupt opposition attacks. The tactic was effective, two late tries seeing the Kiwis to a 12-7 win over Scotland, before Ireland were despatched 15-0 in Dublin. A huge crowd at Crystal Palace convulsed with laughter at the sight of the Haka - but the smiles were soon wiped from their faces when the tourists ran in five tries in a 15-0 hammering of England. New Zealand headed to Wales to meet a country in the midst of its first 'Golden Age,' and the encounter would be the first in a series of controversial clashes between the sides. An excellent try on the left wing by Teddy Morgan sealed a 3-0 win in a hard-fought encounter at Cardiff Arms Park, but post-match talk was dominated by a Bob Deans try that was ruled out by Scottish referee John Dallas. Dallas said that Deans was tackled short, but the Kiwi said he was dragged back into the field of play after grounding a try - on his death-bed three years later he exclaimed: \"I did score that try in Cardiff.\"  Four of the 1905 All Blacks went over to the newly formed 'All Golds' rugby league side soon after the tour, but New Zealand were strong enough to crush an Anglo-Welsh touring team in 1908. The first South Africa tour of New Zealand in 1921 saw honours shared in a three-Test series, starting the greatest rivalry in rugby - and the long-running controversy between the countries over the All Blacks' inclusion of Maori players. The awesome 1924-5 All Black tourists became known as 'The Invincibles' after winning all 30 of their games in France, Britain and Ireland, including a crushing 19-0 victory over Wales at St Helen's. Despite their success, the All Blacks' 2-3-2 scrum formation left them somewhat short of possession at times, and the flaws were exploited by the Springboks in South Africa in 1928. Employing the modern 3-4-1 scrum line-up against the New Zealand 'rover' system for the first time, South African teams defeated the All Blacks in five games and the Test series was drawn two-all. The controversial New Zealand scrum method finally disappeared after the 1930 Lions tour (a series won 3-1 by New Zealand), the Lions manager describing the tactic as 'cheating,' prompting the International Rugby Board to rule that three men had to pack down in the front row of the scrum.  The All Blacks' 1935 European tour started inauspiciously with an 11-3 loss to a Swansea side inspired by teenage, schoolboy half-backs Hayden Tanner and Willie Davies. A thrilling Test at Cardiff Arms Park went to Wales 13-12, although the winning try from Geoffrey Rees-Jones was controversial following an illegal Claude Davey tackle in the build-up. New Zealand's next visit to Wales in 1953 proved difficult as they lost 8-3 to Cardiff and drew 6-6 at Swansea. The All Blacks were on top in the Test with Wales at the Arms Park, but the teams were locked at 8-8 when a Clem Thomas cross kick was gathered by Ken Jones for a famous, match-winning try. The tourists made some amends with wins over the other home nations, before a 19-5 success over the Barbarians in an Arms Park thriller. New Zealand built from that tour, and by the time they returned in 1963-4 they were undoubtedly the leading side in the world.  That made the shock all the greater when a drop goal by student John Uzzell gave Newport an unlikely 3-0 win over the tourists at Rodney Parade. Wilson Whinneray's side rallied to beat Wales 6-0, their first win at the Arms Park in four attempts, and went unbeaten through the rest of the tour, but when they returned home the first question put to them was: \"What happened in Newport?\" The only blemish on the record of the awesome 1967 tourists was a draw with East Wales, as they beat the full Wales team 13-6 in Cardiff to take the lead in the series between the countries for the first time. That lead was increased with two comfortable wins for the home side in New Zealand in 1969, the first time Wales had toured the country as an independent team.  A ferocious game at the Arms Park in 1972 was edged 19-16 by the All Blacks, a measure of revenge for the defeat inflicted on New Zealand by the Carwyn James-inspired Lions of 1971.  James guided Llanelli to a famous 9-3 win over the tourists at Stradey Park, though, and in the final game of the tour the Barbarians defeated the All Blacks 23-11 in Cardiff in a game regarded by many as the greatest ever played. New Zealand defeated a Wales XV 12-3 at the Arms Park in a non-cap game in 1974, but it was the 1978 game in Cardiff that would reignite the history of controversy between the two countries.  Wales were leading 12-10 with one minute left when Andy Haden flew to the floor from a line-out. Television pictures clearly showed that he dived, but English referee Roger Quittenton was fooled and awarded a penalty, duly converted by Brian McKechnie for a 13-12 win. Since that infamous game, the competition has largely left Wales v New Zealand fixtures as the men in red have slipped from the pinnacle of the world game. A crushing 23-3 win for New Zealand in Cardiff in the Welsh Rugby Union's 1980 centenary game was a sign of things to come. The new professionalism in the southern hemisphere game that had left Europe behind was shown as the All Blacks swatted Wales aside 49-6 in Brisbane in the semi-final of the inaugural World Cup. The Kiwis went on to claim the Cup, and would inflict further misery on Wales on their ill-fated 1988 tour of New Zealand.  A young, talented Wales side left Britain full of confidence as Triple Crown winners, but one of the greatest ever New Zealand teams demolished them 52-3 and 54-9. After also taking some fearful beatings in the provincial games, Wales captain Jonathan Davies returned home calling for urgent change in the national game, but as his views were ignored he - along with a generation of Wales' best players - chose to head north to rugby league.  A 34-9 win in Cardiff followed for New Zealand in 1989, and at the 1995 World Cup Wales' big talk was made to look embarrassing as the All Blacks eased to victory in Johannesburg. A crushing 42-7 Kiwi triumph in Wembley followed in 1997, and as Wales' misery increased they turned to New Zealand for their salvation in the shape of coaches Graham Henry and Steve Hansen. There was a temporary resurgence in the Welsh game, but when an experimental New Zealand side came to Cardiff's new Millennium Stadium in 2002 they left with a 43-17 victory.  A bruising 55-3 defeat followed for Wales in Hamilton in 2003 as Hansen built towards the World Cup, but in Australia it was a remarkable performance against the All Blacks that gave his side renewed hope. Wales were given no chance going into the game, but in the course of the match they rediscovered the value of attacking flair to lead 37-33 early in the second half. New Zealand rallied to a 53-37 win, but the style shown by Wales has been used as an inspiration as they look to a better future. They now face an All Blacks team led by Henry and Hansen, coming to Europe with a weakened squad at the end of a long season. An encouraging display against South Africa has inspired a confident Wales camp to believe they can claim their first win over the men in black for over 50 years. They have a chance, but clearly history is not on their side. \n",

      "100.0% Aussie McGrath to take match off  Third one-day international, Auckland: New Zealand v Australia  Match begins 0100 GMT  Opener Matthew Hayden will also sit out the match because of a shoulder injury suffered in the second game on Tuesday. McGrath's place goes to Michael Kasprowicz while Simon Katich replaces Hayden, and will open the batting in preference to Michael Clarke. New Zealand trail 2-0 and need to win in Auckland to keep the five-match series alive. The Black Caps dropped batsman Mathew Sinclair after the opening two defeats, calling in opener Michael Papps and all-rounder Andre Adams. But Adams has been ruled out due to illness, adding to the home side's woes after Scott Styris injured his knee. Batsman James Marshall will make his international debut after acting as 12th man in the last game.  Marshall is the identical twin of Hamish Marshall, New Zealand's best batsman in the first match. News that several batsmen had spent time with the team psychologist on Wednesday added to the air of desperation in the New Zealand camp. But captain Stephen Fleming played that down, and emphasised pride is at stake with three games left in the series. \"We're pretty determined; we know the importance of the match to keep the series alive,\" he said. \"But more importantly we want to play up to the standard we have over the last 12-24 months.\"  Australia have now won 10 of their last 11 one-day matches against New Zealand. And captain Ricky Ponting was in no mood to loosen his side's grip on the series against their local rivals. \"Sure we're in a great position and we've played some pretty good cricket but we still think we can keep improving,\" he said. \"All we can do is keep trying to win and keep trying to improve, and if that means we get a psychological hold over New Zealand then well and good.\"  S Fleming (Capt), N Astle, H Marshall, C McMillan, C Cairns, B McCullum (Wkt), D Vettori, J Wilson, K Mills, D Tuffey, M Papps, J Marshall.

      "100.0% Auckland set forTwenty20  Twenty20 International, Auckland  New Zealand v Australia (Starts Thursday 0600 GMT)  The Black Caps will be without injured Daniel Vettori, though he is likely to play in Saturday's first match of the 50-over one-day series. Former rugby union international Jeff Wilson is included in the 12-man squad for the historic encounter. Australia were given a boost when Matthew Hayden overcame a pleurisy scare to be available for all matches. Double All Black Wilson, who returns to the international line up after a 12-year lay-off, said it was no secret Australia were viewed as being the toughest opponents the Black Caps could face. \"The Aussies are the world's premier team, but we're a pretty accomplished one-day side too, and I'm looking forward to being a part of the challenge,\" said Wilson. \"As a team, we are under no illusions about how tough it will be or how good they are, but it's simply a matter of playing consistently well against them and grabbing all our chances.\" Although the tour focus remains firmly fixed on the opening one-day international, New Zealand coach John Bracewell said the Twenty20 match was a good opportunity to have an early \"sighter\" of each other.  \"The Twenty20 match might be a chance to get first psychological points with a long series ahead,\" said Bracewell. Statistics may favour New Zealand, who have not lost a home series in four years, but statistics count for nothing compared to current form where Australia have an aura of invincibility. Australia, meanwhile, flew out of Sydney on Wednesday for the tour, dismissing suggestions they already have their minds on the Ashes series in England this summer. The tour is Australia's final workout ahead of the Ashes trip and while England are looming as a potentially greater threat, captain Ricky Ponting said his team were only worried about New Zealand. \"I think a lot of the media are talking about the Ashes series, but we know that we have got this very big and vital series to play first,\" said Ponting. \"New Zealand are a very good side and they are hard to beat in in Australia and a lot harder to beat over there.\"  S Fleming (cpt).

      "100.0% England claim historic series win  Fifth Test, Centurion, day five: South Africa 247 & 296-6d drew with England 359 & 73-4  England win five-match series 2-1  Centuries from Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers allowed South Africa to declare on 296-6, setting England a target of 185 to win from 44 overs. The tourists chose not to chase the runs, however, finishing on 73-4. There were plenty of nervous moments when they lost early wickets but captain Michael Vaughan held firm to secure a 2-1 series triumph. Though the usually brilliant Andrew Strauss scored a duck, only Denis Compton had ever scored more runs in a series against South Africa and he won the man-of-the-series award for his three centuries. Kallis and man-of-the-match de Villiers were in occupation of the crease when the day started, with South Africa still trailing by 53 runs. By the time they had been parted, they had added 227 for the third wicket. The scoring rate was never sensational, however, as Vaughan declined to set over-attacking fields and the batsman refused to take undue risks.  It took more than an hour for the lead to be wiped off, as De Villiers hit arguably the shot of the day - a pull off Matthew Hoggard that went all the way for six. The remaining hour-and-a-half of an extended morning session saw a further 100 runs added. The two right-handers were quick to pull and drive when the opportunities presented themselves. Kallis was twice lucky to survive. At one point he edged Hoggard inches short of Marcus Trescothick at slip and then, on 76, looked lucky to survive an lbw appeal against Simon Jones. De Villiers reached his half-century with a square drive off Ashley Giles for four, and he continued to play the spinner with great certainty. In the afternoon session, it was widely assumed South Africa would throw the bat at almost everything. First, however, both batsmen needed to reach their centuries.  Kallis got there first, cutting Jones for four - it was his fifth Test ton against England and 20th in all. The 20-year-old de Villiers became the third youngest South African to hit a Test century with a boundary in the same area off the same bowler. But he then perished when holing out to third man off Jones. He had made 109 off 169 balls. Oddly, Kallis took stock for a while before launching a few more boundaries shortly before the declaration, finally finishing unbeaten on 136. In the hunt for quick runs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Rudolph and Mark Boucher all perished for single figure scores. A grateful Steve Harmison took his first two wickets since Cape Town and Hoggard added a single victim to finish with 26 in the series. Set 185 from 44 overs, England were never in position to go for the target once Strauss had been caught behind in Ntini's first over.  Things looked dicey when Robert Key provided just 40 minutes of uncertain resistance before edging Pollock to Boucher. And there were certainly a few skipped heartbeats in the England dressing-room when Trescothick inexplicably missed a straight ball from Ntini to be bowled. That left 29 overs remaining for South Africa to try to find the last seven wickets. Vaughan and Graham Thorpe, however, proved adept at blunting some impressive spells from all the bowlers until Ntini returned to have Thorpe caught by Herschelle Gibbs who was close in at third slip. England had just about done enough by then and the game ended in bad light two-and-half overs early with Vaughan 26 not out and Andrew Flintoff unbeaten on 14. It was England's first series win in South Africa since MJK Smith led them to a 1-0 win in 1964-65. And it earned them the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy, named after the player who the South African apartheid regime refused to allow to tour their country with England in 1968, ultimately resulting in their exclusion from international sport.

      "98.7% Rain holds up England  Fifth Test, Centurion. South Africa v England  Start delayed, rain  England lead the series 2-1 with just this final Test remaining so South Africa desperately need to win. The officials had hoped play could get under way at noon local time but a further downpour led to an early lunch being taken by the players. For England, Simon Jones is expected to replace James Anderson while the hosts play both Andrew Hall and Andre Nel, with batsman Boeta Dippenaar dropped. Dale Steyn had already been released from the squad for Centurion and it means South Africa go in with five seamers and one spin bowler.  On Friday, England captain Michael Vaughan had said it was important his team targeted victory and not simply a draw. He said: \"You can't set out over five days to draw a game. We have to try to win. If you go out in a mindset to draw you don't have the right attitude. \"We'll just set out in a positive manner and try to put the South Africans under a lot of pressure.\" England, who have not won a series in South Africa for 40 years, will play on a green pitch which has endured a long spell of wet and humid weather. The weather forecast for Saturday onwards is fine, and early starts on all four days from then could ensure there is plenty of time to achieve a result.  Middlesex opener Andrew Strauss, with a stunning aggregate of 612 runs in the four Tests played to date, said South Africa had every incentive to throw caution to the wind. He said: \"It's been a great series for me. It's been very satisfying. \"But I think we all realise that this last game is very important and we can't afford to take our foot off the pedal now. \"Sometimes when you've got a lead it's quite hard to keep yourself motivated.  \"We are pretty sure that the South Africans will come back hard at us. They have a lot of motivation to do well against us this week.\" South Africa captain Graeme Smith said the colour of the pitch was probably misleading. He said: \"The pitch has played pretty well all year. It might look a bit juicy but will probably play pretty good.\" He added that his team had the capability of bouncing back. \"We came back in New Zealand from 1-0 down to level the series in Wellington so we've been in this situation before. \"We've just got to play some really good cricket for four to five days. We've had had a lot of iffy performances so far. \"With a bit of luck here or there or playing some better cricket at certain times it could have easily been the other way round. \"It's been that sort of series, ebb and flow, and I'm sure it's going to be that way again.\"  Graeme Smith (capt.), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher (wkt), Andrew Hall, Nicky Boje, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel.

      "100.0% England eye win after Thorpe ton  Second Test, Durban, day four (close): England: 139 & 570-7d v South Africa 332 & 21-1  Thorpe shared in stands of 114 with Andrew Flintoff (60) and 132 with Geraint Jones (73) after England had lost three for 21 in the morning. The left-hander's 16th Test ton came off 209 balls and included 15 fours. The hosts fell to 21-1 at stumps, with Matthew Hoggard trapping home skipper Graeme Smith lbw for five. To win, South Africa will have to break their own chasing record at the ground, which they set in 2002 when scoring 340 to beat Australia. On day three South Africa waited all day for a wicket, but three came along at once when play resumed on the fourth. Makhaya Ntini was the man to ignite the flame, tempting Andrew Strauss into a dalliance outside the off-stump which was pouched by Martin van Jaarsveld at third slip.  The prolific opener had added only four runs to his overnight 132 when departing. Ntini followed up with the wicket of Michael Vaughan, whose poor run continued when he was cramped up by a short ball and gloved behind for 10, taking his four-innings aggregate this series to 53. Shaun Pollock was doing a fine job tying up his end, and England soon fell to 314-4 when Jacques Kallis put an end to Mark Butcher's painful 70-ball 13. It left the visitors' leading by just 121 with the middle-order exposed, but the lack of depth in South Africa's attack gave England the chance to stabilise. With Graeme Smith forced to rely on support acts Dale Steyn (1-122) and Nicky Boje (1-163), England reasserted thanks to Thorpe and his partnerships with Flintoff and Jones. Flintoff, careful to avoid a pair of ducks, was indecisive early on, edging streakily for four and being struck on the shoulder in one Steyn over. But the all-rounder ended the first session with a full-blooded cover-drive that sent Steyn to the fence, and he carried on in similar vein after the interval. A six off Pollock over long-on was followed by two more off Ntini over square-leg, and Flintoff emulated Thorpe by reaching 50 with a boundary. South Africa's only strike of the afternoon came when Smith offered a long-hop to Flintoff and enticed an edge, which AB de Villiers gloved behind the stumps. England's scoring rate increased when Jones came to the crease, and he complemented Thorpe's grafting approach with some abrasive strokeplay. The keeper blazed 73 off 82 balls, with 10 fours and two sixes, as England chased quick runs prior to the declaration, joining Thorpe in top-edging the hapless Steyn over the keeper's head on numerous occasions. South Africa were forced to place a fielder at long-stop, but the runs continued to flow until Jones holed out at long-on to give Boje his sole strike. Ashley Giles, who will be fit to bowl in day five after suffering back spasms, came out to bat, but his swift removal by Steyn prompted the declaration.

      "100.0% South Africa back in contention  First Test, Port Elizabeth, day three (stumps): South Africa 337 & 99-2 v England 425  England, who resumed play on 227-1, were bowled out for 425 after losing three wickets for 29 runs and four for 12 in two separate mini-collapses. Makhaya Ntini took three wickets in four balls before returning 3-75. South Africa then lost AB de Villiers and Jacques Rudolph before closing on 99-2, a lead of 11 runs. The hosts emerged for the day's play with renewed zeal after their listless display in the field on Saturday. Andrew Strauss could add only six to his overnight score of 120 before cutting Shaun Pollock on the up and picking out de Villiers at point.  Michael Vaughan, fresh from his run-hungry deeds against Zimbabwe and South Africa A, broadcast his levels of confidence with a six over third man off Andrew Hall. But it was to prove a false dawn as two balls later the England captain dallied outside the off-stump to a fuller delivery and was caught at slip. Graham Thorpe was unimpressive in 45 minutes in the middle, scoring just four before being bowled around his legs sweeping at Graeme Smith's amateur off-breaks.  Although three strikes in the morning was a good return for the hosts, Butcher was keeping the score ticking over with an array of pulled and cut boundaries, and they were doing themselves no favours by continually no-balling. In the entire innings, South Africa conceded a national record 57 extras, including 35 no-balls. Debutant Dale Steyn was the chief culprit, overstepping 16 times. Butcher and Andrew Flintoff built a promising 79-run stand either side of lunch, and the former's 12th boundary midway through the afternoon took the recovering visitors into the lead. Ntini, unthreatening to this point, then turned the game on its head with three wickets in four balls to orchestrate a one-time familiar middle-order collapse. Butcher's demise - a faint edge through to impressive keeper Thami Tsolekile - was a soft way to end a 23rd Test fifty that looked like becoming his ninth ton.  If his departure was unthinking, Flintoff's was plain mindless. The powerful all-rounder had ridden a difficult period to move to 35, but threw his wicket away when despatching a deliberate short ball down the throat of Rudolph at deep square. Geraint Jones misread the sluggishness of the pitch to be caught at short extra cover next ball, and though Matthew Hoggard kept out the hat-trick ball he soon fell to Hall for a duck to reduce his team to 358-8. Ashley Giles emphasized his worth down the order with a brisk 26, putting on 36 with Simon Jones before edging Pollock to slip. Another 31 runs were added for the final wicket, during which time Steve Harmison was dropped twice and caught off a Steyn no-ball.  Steyn kept his foot behind the popping crease to eventually get rid of Jones for 24 and end England's first innings. Hoggard, so industrious with the ball in the first innings, again served his team well when snatching a wonderful, low-down catch off his own bowling to remove de Villiers for 14. A sizeable first-innings deficit still hung over the hosts on 26-1, but with Hoggard seemingly straining his side and Harmison (0-29 off six overs) way off colour England did not fully cash in. It took the introduction of Giles to oust Rudolph (caught at slip) for a nicely crafted 29, but Smith (33) and Jacques Kallis (10) comfortably saw South Africa out of the red and to the safety of stumps. The day belonged to the home side, but they will need to repeat the dose on Monday to ensure they cannot be beaten in the series' opener.

      "97.4% England duo hit centuries  Second Test, Durban, day three (close): England: 139 & 281-1 v South Africa 332  Both hit 132 - Strauss was unbeaten - as England finished day three 88 ahead on 281-1, having started it 163 behind. It was the 16th 200-run opening stand in England's history, and by the time Trescothick was bowled by Shaun Pollock it was the country's fifth best ever. Mark Butcher was Strauss's partner at stumps in Durban, unbeaten on one. Trescothick bludgeoned 20 fours and two sixes in his 261-ball innings, with Strauss hitting 16 boundaries from 272 balls faced. It was the duo's fourth stand of 150 or more and their best return in nine Tests together, bettering the 190 they shared against New Zealand at Lord's this summer. In what had been a low-scoring game, England started the day on 30-0 and seemingly with a mountain to climb. But, allied to some loose bowling, the vagaries of the pitch which had hindered them on day one had disappeared to make life easier for England.  The first-wicket pair was circumspect in the opening 30 minutes of play, but soon feasted on the tripe served up by Dale Steyn, whose three-over spell cost 31 runs. The rookie paceman bowled short and wide, inviting Strauss to hook at will and Trescothick to take him for three successive boundaries through the off-side. The transformation of England - and indeed the pitch - was illustrated by their lunch score of 137-0, just two runs fewer than their entire first-innings effort. South Africa looked seriously bereft of options in the afternoon, with skipper Graeme Smith fruitlessly turning to himself, Steyn returning to the attack and Nicky Boje failing to threaten.  Pollock was the only one to bother England's rampant openers, beating the outside edge of both batsmen. But there was to be no moving the batsmen as they rose through the ranks of England's greatest first-wicket stands. England's previous best in Durban - 160 by Wally Hammond and Bob Wyatt 73 years ago - fell away, and 31 runs later a new record for all teams at the ground was set. When the 200-run mark was passed, it was the first time England's opening wicket had done so since Graeme Gooch and Mike Atherton against Australia in 1991.  The openers reached triple figures within moments of each other, Trescothick for the ninth time and Strauss for the fourth - and second in two Tests. Both carried on in the same vein after tea, with Trescothick hoicking Boje over mid-wicket for six and Strauss striking successive fours in the same over. South Africa's only hope looked to be the new ball, and the dependable Pollock finally gave the hosts something to cheer when Trescothick edged a simple catch behind late on. Strauss, chanceless all day, next over gave South Africa a sniff when edging Ntini low down to second slip, where Martin van Jaarsveld spilled a tough one-handed chance. Bad light ceased play 11 overs ahead of schedule, and play will start 30 minutes early on day four.

      "100.0% Henman to face Saulnier test  British number one Tim Henman will face France's Cyril Saulnier in the first round of next week's Australian Open.  Greg Rusedski, the British number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face Andy Roddick in the second round if he beats Swede Jonas Bjorkman. Local favourite Lleyton Hewitt will meet France's Arnaud Clement, while defending champion and world number one Roger Federer faces Fabrice Santoro. Women's top seed Lindsay Davenport drew Spanish veteran Conchita Martinez.  Henman came from two sets down to defeat Saulnier in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year's first major and is lined up to meet Roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. \"He's tough player on any surface, he's got a lot of ability,\" he said. \"We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I'm going to need to play well from the outset because he's a dangerous competitor.\" Switzerland's Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten Santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. \"It's a tricky match,\" Federer said. \"I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. \"The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.\" The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion Andre Agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian Marat Safin, the player he beat in last year's final.  Eighth-seeded American Agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed Andy Roddick will open his campaign against Irakli Labadze of Georgia. The American could meet Rusedski in the second round, seventh seed Henman in the quarter-finals and Hewitt in the last four. Hewitt is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mark Edmondson in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to Federer, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.  In the women's draw, Davenport could encounter eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked Anastasia Myskina, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. Venus Williams, who lost to younger sister Serena in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against Eleni Daniilidou of Greece.

      "99.3% Roche 'turns down Federer offer'  Australian tennis coach Tony Roche has turned down an approach from Roger Federer to be the world number one's new full-time coach, say reports.  Melbourne's Herald-Sun said Roche, troubled by a hip complaint, did not want to travel full-time again. However, Roche is happy to work with the Swiss star on a casual basis and is helping him prepare for next month's defence of his Australian Open crown. Federer has been without a coach since splitting with Peter Lundgren in 2003. Roche, a former Davis Cup player for Australia, won the French Open, reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and won five Wimbledon doubles titles with John Newcombe.  He also coached former number one Ivan Lendl and Pat Rafter to Grand Slam victories and has worked with Australia's Lleyton Hewitt. Some reports claim Federer initially wanted Andre Agassi's Australian coach Darren Cahill, before Agassi confirmed he would play on in 2005. Federer was named Swiss sportsman of the year on Saturday, to add to the BBC overseas sportsman and European Sports Journalists Association awards he has already won. \n",

      "100.0% Federer joins all-time greats  The last year has seen one player dominate men's tennis, and one country dominate the women's game.  Roger Federer became the first man since Mats Wilander in 1988 to win three Grand Slams in one season. And after Anastasia Myskina became the first Russian woman to win a Grand Slam at the French Open, two more followed at Wimbledon and the US Open. Meanwhile, Briton Tim Henman enjoyed his best year, while Greg Rusedski fought back superbly from adversity. Federer began the year as world number one and holder of the Wimbledon and Masters Cup titles, and set about conquering new ground. The Swiss sounded warning of the dominance to come at the Australian Open.  He ripped through the draw before beating Marat Safin in the final. Andy Roddick was the only player to put up any real resistance at Wimbledon, and Federer's performance against Lleyton Hewitt in the US Open final was breathtaking. Federer again got the better of Hewitt in the season-ending Masters Cup. His victory in Houston proved to be his 13th successive win in a final, an Open era record. The only major let-down was a third-round loss to Gustavo Kuerten at the French Open, and Roland Garros will be his main target in 2005.  There was also a surprise loss to the unheralded Tomas Berdych at the Olympic Games, which saw Chile dominate as Nicoals Massu took the singles and then paired up with Fernando Gonzaelz to win doubles gold. Another major trophy that looks beyond Federer is the Davis Cup, which was won by Spain in a 3-2 home success over the USA in Seville. Roddick struggled on the clay, losing to Rafael Nadal on the opening day before going down to Carlos Moya in the all-important fourth rubber.  Henman broke new ground by reaching the semis on clay at the French Open - a stunning effort - and also at the US Open. A quarter-final defeat to Mario Ancic at Wimbledon was disappointing for the limp manner of the Briton's defeat, but he remains optimistic of going further next year.  British number two Rusedski endured a rollercoaster year, returning to the circuit after being cleared of a doping offence in March. With his ranking down at 168, many feared the 31-year-old's career was over, but he battled back in the second half of the season to re-enter the top 50. The Russian women finally delivered on their long-recognised promise in 2004, with Myskina, Maria Sharapova and Svetlana Kuznetsova winning Grand Slams, before taking the season-ending Fed Cup. But while the young Russians were on the way up, it was a different story for the Belgians and the Williams sisters. Only veteran Lindsay Davenport held the new wave at bay, a stunning run of form after Wimbledon taking her to number one ahead of Amelie Mauresmo, whose Grand Slam drought goes on. The year started in regulation fashion as Justine Henin-Hardenne beat compatriot Kim Clijsters at the Australian Open.  A virus ruined the rest of Henin-Hardenne's year, although she was fit enough to win Olympic gold, but Clijsters had an even more miserable 2004. She suffered a serious wrist injury and then announced the end of her relationship with Lleyton Hewitt, and will be happy to see the year end. In their absence, Myskina thrashed Elena Dementieva in a historic, but woeful, all-Russian final at the French Open. Wimbledon was a more refreshing affair as Sharapova captivated SW19, showing nerves of steel as she battled past Davenport and Serena Williams to take the title.  Davenport was a strong favourite for the US Open but, hampered by injury, lost to the powerful and unflappable Kuznetsova in the semis. Kuznetsova went on to give Dementieva another Grand Slam final thrashing, with the latter's wayward serve becoming one of the talking points of the year. With the Russians still improving, the likes of Henin-Hardenne, Clijsters, Davenport, Mauresmo, Venus and Serena will need to be fully fit and motivated in 2005. And it may take their compatriot Safin to challenge Federer on the men's side. \n",

      "100.0% Serena becomes world number two  Serena Williams has moved up five places to second in the world rankings after her Australian Open win.  Williams won her first Grand Slam title since 2003 with victory over Lindsay Davenport, the world number one. Men's champion Marat Safin remains fourth in the ATP rankings while beaten finalist Lleyton Hewitt replaces Andy Roddick as world number two. Roger Federer retains top spot, but Safin has overtaken Hewitt to become the new leader of the Champions Race. Alicia Molik, who lost a three-set thriller against Davenport in the quarter-finals, is in the women's top 10 for the first time in her career. Her rise means Australia have a player in the top 10 of the men's and women's rankings for the first time in 21 years. And Britain's Elena Baltacha, who qualified and then reached the third round, has risen to 120 in the world - a leap of 65 places and her highest ranking yet. \n",

      "98.6% Safin cool on Wimbledon  Newly-crowned Australian Open champion Marat Safin has ruled out any chance of winning Wimbledon in the future.  After losing in round one last year, Safin said he had \"given up\" on Wimbledon and winning his second Grand Slam title has not changed his mind. \"I'll play, but with no expectations. I feel like I can't waste my time, my energy on that surface,\" he said. \"Some people, they cannot play on clay. Some people, they cannot play on a hard court. Me, I can't play on grass.\" However, Safin is hopeful that winning the Australian Open will give him the belief he needs to win more Grand Slam titles. \"It's a relief for me. Two grand slams, it's already something. But with this one I worked really hard for it,\" he said. \"Basically, I would love to win a couple more. I think I have a chance if I continue this way.  \"If (coach) Peter Lundgren will stick around with me and wants to work with me for a bit longer, I think I can make it.\" The 25-year-old shocked Pete Sampras in the 2000 US Open final to win his first major title but then lost in two Australian Open finals. Safin admitted he had begun to doubt whether he would win another Grand Slam. \"I didn't expect that (to win the 2000 US Open) - it was against Sampras, I wasn't the favourite so I had no pressure whatsoever,\" he said. \"After the first final that I didn't win against Thomas Johansson (in 2002), I couldn't see myself winning the Grand Slams anymore. \"I was once in the semi-finals of the French Open, but I didn't believe I can win it. \"I just couldn't handle the pressure. You need to believe in yourself, and I didn't.\"  And after losing the first set 6-1 to Lleyton Hewitt in Sunday's final, Safin said he began to doubt himself again. \"I am 25. I'm playing against Hewitt. At least you have to have the opportunity to win it, at least have a chance,\" he said. \"It's like you go there and you lose first set 6-1, then you start to think: 'This is not my day. The way I'm playing is ridiculous.' \"But then you start to really be a little bit more selfish and try to find a way out of there. \"And I found it. I was like really much I was much happier than in 2000, that's for sure, because I get over it.\" \n",

      "94.4% Holmes back on form in Birmingham  Double Olympic champion Kelly Holmes was back to her best as she comfortably won the 1,000m at the Norwich Union Birmingham Indoor Grand Prix.  The 34-year-old, running only her second competitive race of the season, shook off the rust to win in two minutes, 35.39 seconds. But she is still undecided about competing in the European Championships in Madrid from 4-6 March. \"I'll probably be entered and make my mind up at the last minute,\" she said. \"My training hasn't gone as well as expected but I've got two weeks to decide. \"I need to take my time and make sure I feel good about what I'm doing. \"I felt very good here but with the crowd behind you, you feel like you can do anything.\" American  was the eventual winner of the men's 60m race which almost ended in farce. Three athletes were disqualified for false starting, including Britain's Mark Lewis-Francis, who was the first man guilty of coming out of his blocks too quickly. World 100m champion Kim Collins clinched second spot ahead of world 60m record holder and Scott's training partner Maurice Greene. Jason Gardener's unbeaten run came to an end as he came fifth and he will need to improve if he is to defend his European title in Madrid. \"You can't win them all,\" said Gardener afterwards. \"And I was very disappointed as I know I'm capable of doing better.\" Russian  was back on record-breaking form in the pole vault at the National Indoor Arena.  The Olympic champion set a new world mark of 4.88m to break her own record - which she set just six days ago - and beat Russian rival Svetlana Feofanova. It was Isinbayeva's 11th world record - indoors or out - since July 2003. \"I'm so happy and I will do my best to break the 5m barrier soon,\" the 22-year-old told BBC Sport. Jamaica's  stormed to a personal best of 7.13 seconds to claim the women's 60m sprint. Belgian Kim Gevaert, who will be one of the favourites for next month's European title, took second while American Muna Lee was third. There was disappointment for British pair Jeanette Kwakye and Joice Maduaka who finished seventh and eighth respectively.  Jamaican  stretched her unbeaten record to 25 races as she effortlessly claimed the 200m. The Olympic champion set a new indoor personal best of 22.38 seconds - the fastest time in the world this season.  fought off fellow Briton Tim Abeyie to take the men's 200m in a personal best of 20.88.  continued her outstanding start to the season, beating a strong international field, which included two-time Olympic 100m hurdles bronze medallist Melissa Morrison, to claim the women's 60m hurdles. The 25-year-old Briton clocked 7.98 seconds while pre-European Championships favourite Russian Irina Shevchenko finished down in sixth. Ethiopia's  failed in her bid to smash compatriot Berhane Adere's world 3,000m record but still won the event in emphatic style. The Olympic 5,000m champion was inside record pace but dropped off over the final third, finishing in eight minutes, 33.05 seconds - the fourth fastest time ever recorded for the event. Britain's Jo Pavey bravely decided to go with Defar as she strode away from the field and took second in a season's best 8:41.43. Kenyan  also missed out on the indoor 1500m world record, which Hicham El Guerrouj has held for the last eight years.  Lagat settled for silver behind El Guerrouj in Athens and was almost four seconds short of the Moroccan's world best, clocking 3:35.27 in Birmingham. And  was still struggling to find his form after the death of his fiancee this year. The Olympic 10,000m champion had comfortably led the men's two mile race after his younger brother Tariku had set the pace. But fellow Ethiopian  appeared ominously on Bekele's shoulder with two laps to go before surging past him at the bell to win in 8:14.28. Jamaican  made the most of a blistering start to take the men's 400m title in 45.91 seconds. World indoor champion, Alleyne Francique, faded badly and finished in fourth while American duo Jerry Harris and James Davis took second and third respectively. Swede  showed her class in the long jump as she stole top spot from Jade Johnson with the very last jump of the competition. The Olympic heptathlon gold medallist reached 6.66m to better Johnson's mark of 6.52m - her second personal best inside a week. \"I was quite surprised because I didn't think I'd end up with second place,\" said Johnson, who wore London's 2012 Olympic bid slogan, \"Back the Bid\", on her shorts. \"But I'm pleased and hopefully I'll get a bit better for the Europeans. I really want to win a medal.\"  won the men's event with a season's best of 7.95m, taking the scalp of world indoor champion Savante Stringfellow of the USA. \n",

      "99.9% GB select Holmes for double bid  Kelly Holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's European Indoor Championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.  The double-Olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first European Indoors in Madrid. But UK Athletics chief Max Jones believes it is likely Holmes will race. He said: \"It's worth a punt, isn't it? She's gone back to training. If she's confident she will pick one (distance). The programme does not permit both.\" If Holmes does take her place in the GB side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. Under championship rules, she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in Madrid on 4 March. Jones added: \"She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend's Grand Prix). \"I am inclined to think she will (compete). It could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.\" And he admitted Holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the Norwich Union GB team. \"She is a very good team member and is very good to have there,\" he added. Meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the Great Britain team announced on Tuesday.  Defending 60m champion Jason Gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. He will be joined in the event by Mark Lewis-Francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in Vienna - and new boy Darren Chin. Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. Sotherton finished third in the Olympic heptathlon in Athens, where the Swede took gold. There are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in GB's 46-strong team. The championships will be the last to be attended by Jones before he retires to be succeeded by Dave Collins. Jones said: \"The Olympic Games is the overwhelming target for UKA and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games. \"The European Indoor Championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. \"Madrid is the first small step on a long journey to Beijing and the 2008 Olympics but for some of the emerging athletes, this will be a very important step.\"  60m: D Chin (Belgrave Harriers), J Gardener (Wessex and Bath), M Lewis-Francis (Birchfield Harriers).

      "100.0% Bekele sets sights on world mark  Olympic 10,000m champion Kenenisa Bekele is determined to add the world indoor two mile record at February's Norwich Union Grand Prix in Birmingham.  The 22-year-old will again be chasing a record held by his compatriot and mentor Haile Gebrselassie, who set the mark at the same meeting in 2003. \"I am still as hungry to do as much as I can in this sport,\" said Bekele. \"And aiming for the two mile world record in Birmingham is the next of those targets.\" Gebrselassie's current record stands at eight minutes, 04.69 seconds. And Bekele is no stranger to overhauling world marks at the National Indoor Arena. The Ethiopian broke the world indoor 5,000m record on his debut at the meeting last year. Compatriots Mulugeta Wondimu, Abiyote Abate and Markos Geneti, the world indoor bronze medallist over 3000m, will race against Bekele on 18 February. The meet has already attracted a crop of Olympic talent. Britain's 800m and 1500m champion Kelly Holmes is taking part in the 1000m.

      "97.1% Britain boosted by Holmes double  Athletics fans endured a year of mixed emotions in 2004 as stunning victories went hand-in-hand with disappointing defeats and more drugs scandals.  Kelly Holmes finally fulfilled her potential by storming to double gold on the track at the Olympic Games. Holmes helped erase the gloom hanging over Team GB after their biggest medal hope, Paula Radcliffe, dropped out of the marathon and then the 10,000m. Britain's men's 4x100m relay team also did their bit by taking a shock gold. Holmes had started the year in disappointing style, falling over in the final of 1500m at the World Indoor Championships where she was favourite. Her Olympic build-up was clouded by self doubt but that proved unfounded as she overhauled rival Maria Mutola to win the 800m - her first global title. Just five days later, the 34-year-old made it double gold in the 1500m. It was the first time in 84 years a Briton has achieved the Olympic middle-distance double. While Holmes left Athens as the star of Team GB, it was Radcliffe who carried expectations before the August Games.  The 30-year-old marathon world record holder went into the Athens event as favourite but an exhausted Radcliffe dropped out after 23 miles in tears. Her decision to enter the 10,000m five days later also backfired as she again pulled out with eight laps remaining.  But Radcliffe helped put her Olympic trauma behind her with a thrilling win in November's New York Marathon. The 4x100m team grabbed some last-gasp glory for the British men's Olympic squad after a poor start to the Games.  It seemed as though Athens would be the first Games where the men would fail to win a medal with Michael East the only individual track finalist in the 1500m. But Darren Campell, Jason Gardener, Marlon Devonish and Mark Lewis-Francis made amends in the sprint relay. The quartet held off favourites the USA to win Britain's first relay medal since 1912 in 38.07 seconds. Gardener added the Olympic relay crown to his World Indoor title over 60m and, just like Holmes, finally lived up to his promise in 2004. Kelly Sotherton completed Team GB's athletics medal haul in Athens with a surprise bronze in the heptathlon. The 28-year-old won her first championship medal since becoming a full-time athlete in 2003.  But it was a different story for Britain's defending champion Denise Lewis, who withdrew on day two of the competition after some poor results. Lewis, who was troubled by injury, has ruled out retiring while Sotherton is tipped to build on her success. The Athens Olympics proved to be a landmark occasion for Steve Backley, who retired from competition after finishing fourth in the javelin. The battling 35-year-old leaves the sport with a vast medal haul including two silvers and one Olympic bronze.  And Backley's departure was balanced by the return of injury-hit decathlete Dean Macey, who came fourth in Athens.  The continued improvement of sprinter Abi Oyepitan and long jumper Chris Tomlinson also boosted Team GB. Sadly, the 2004 Olympics did not escape the problems of drugs misuse. On the eve of the Games, Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou missed a drugs test and claimed to have been involved in a road crash.  Kenteris, the 200m champion in 2000, and Thanou have since been charged by the Greek authorities and await trial. At the Games, Adrian Annus (hammer), Robert Fazelas (discus) and Irina Korzhanenko (shot) were all stripped of their titles because of doping issues. Hungarian compatriots Annus and Fazelas both refused to give urine samples while Russian Korzhanenko tested positive for the steroid stanozolol.  The fallout from the THG scandal, which rocked the sport in 2003, continued to impact in Olympic year. Britain's 4x100m team took gold without the services of Dwain Chambers, who was handed a two-year ban in February after testing positive for steroid THG.  American Kelli White was suspended and stripped of her world 100m and 200m titles after failing a drugs test. And world 400m champion Jerome Young landed a life ban from US chiefs after a second doping offence. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbayeva provided some light relief by smashing the world record seven times on her way to the World Indoor and Olympic titles. Her rivalry with compatriot Svetlana Feofanova livened up the field events. Morocco's Hicham El Guerrouj also delighted fans by racing to a historic Olympic double in the 1500m and 5,000m.  And though there was no Paula Radcliffe in the London Marathon, there was plenty of drama as Kenyans Evans Rutto and Margaret Okayo took the titles. Rutto held on to win despite slipping on some cobblestones and tumbling into a barrier. Okayo also had to battle back after mistiming her tactics but clinched victory on her debut. \n",

      "100.0% Desailly backs Blues revenge trip  Marcel Desailly insists there is no chance of history repeating itself when Chelsea take on Barcelona on Wednesday.  The French star was part of the Chelsea side crushed 5-1 at the Nou Camp in the Champions League quarter-final second leg in 2000. \"Things will be totally different this time,\" he told BBC Sport. \"Now everyone knows about Chelsea and is a little bit afraid of them. They are one of the major clubs in Europe and the pressure will be on Barcelona.\" Chelsea have not played Barcelona since that quarter-final tie five years ago. The Blues had looked destined to progress after winning the first leg at Stamford Bridge 3-1, courtesy of two goals from Tore Andre Flo and one by Gianfranco Zola. But they collapsed in the second leg, going down to strikes from Rivaldo (2), Luis Figo, Dani and Patrick Kluivert.  Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.  \"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea.  He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it's amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\" \n",

Former Chelsea captain Desailly, who is now playing for Al-Gharafa in Qatar, says there is no comparison between that side and the current Blues team, who are top of the Premiership. \"Mentally they are much stronger, even though a lot of their players are young,\" the 36-year-old said. \"We made some mistakes at the Nou Camp in 2000 - a lot of them were individual mistakes. \"It would not happen now. This team has a new motivation and a different mentality.\" World Cup winner Desailly saw huge changes during his time at Stamford Bridge. He was signed for Â£4.6m from AC Milan in 1998 by Ruud Gullit and went on to play under Gianluca Vialli and Claudio Ranieri. But the biggest change occurred when billionaire Roman Abramovich bought the club in 2003. Desailly says the Russian's arrival helped to instil a winning mentality at the club as well as a demand for success. \"The whole of Chelsea is different now - the chairman, the manager and all the players,\" he said.  \"Everything is new and there is a huge determination to win. \"Since that game in 2000, Chelsea have gained more experience in Europe and were very close to reaching the Champions League final last season.\" Desailly is one of the most decorated players in the history of football. He won the 1998 World Cup and 2000 European Championship with France, the Champions League in 1993 with Marseilles and 1994 with AC Milan, two Serie A titles and the FA Cup in 2000 with Chelsea. He is now winding down his career in Qatar, alongside the likes of Frank Lebeouf, Josep Guardiola, Titi Camara, Gabriel Batistuta and Christophe Dugarry. So he is full of admiration for two of his colleagues from the great Milan side of the mid-90s who are likely to line up against Manchester United on Wednesday - Paolo Maldini and Alessandro Costacurta. \"I'm happy that they have managed to play so long at a high level,\" he said. \"I made a vow to Costacurta that as long as he plays, I will continue to play. \"And it's amazing that Paolo has managed to play at such a high level for such a long time.\" \n",

      "100.0% Mourinho defiant on Chelsea form  Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho has insisted that Sir Alex Ferguson and Arsene Wenger would swap places with him.  Mourinho's side were knocked out of the FA Cup by Newcastle last Sunday before seeing Barcelona secure a 2-1 Champions League first-leg lead in the Nou Camp. But he denied his club was suffering a dip in form which league rivals Arsenal and Manchester United could exploit. \"They cannot speak to us about blips because they're not in a better position than us,\" Mourinho said. \"Do they want to change positions with us? We are top of the league by nine points and in the Carling Cup final. \"The only thing they can say they are in a better position than us in is the FA Cup. \"In the Champions League all three teams can either go through or go out but the one team that is in the best position is still Chelsea.\"  Mourinho said it was important to keep his team's results in perspective. \"Don't try to put pressure on me because I am never under pressure,\" he warned. \"We have lost one important game this week - at Newcastle - and we're out of the FA Cup but I don't think a defeat in a first-leg tie is a real defeat. We are just 2-1 down at half-time.\" Asked if his Chelsea honeymoon was now over, Mourinho replied: \"I have had 20 years of honeymoons with my wife. \"The day that this club is not happy with me is the day that I go.\" \n",

      "100.0% Gerrard plays down European hopes  Steven Gerrard has admitted that Liverpool have little chance of winning the Champions League this season.  The 24-year-old Reds skipper spoke out ahead of Tuesday's first leg at home to Bayer Leverkusen in the last 16, which he will miss through suspension. \"Let's be realistic, there are some fantastic teams left in the Champions League,\" he told BBC Radio Five Live. \"We are just going to try to stay in as long as possible but we realise that maybe it is not our year this year.\" Gerrard has made no secret of his desire to be involved in Europe's premier club competition.  Last season he described qualification for the Champions League as the \"be all and end all\" - and rumours persist that he will leave Anfield if the Reds fail to secure a place in the competition. He has consistently been linked with a move away from Liverpool, with Chelsea the favourites to snap up the England midfielder. And Blues boss Jose Mourinho backed Gerrard's view that Rafael Benitez's team could struggle to progress this season. \"Rafa has still time in front of him to build an even better team, maybe he's a little bit behind (right now),\" he told BBC Radio Five Live.  Gerrard, who fired Liverpool into the last 16 of this season's competition with a brilliant goal in December's win over Olympiakos, insisted he was still fully focused on helping Liverpool to glory this season. The Reds are currently fifth in the Premiership table, five points off the crucial fourth spot, which brings Champions League qualification - and they face Chelsea in Sunday's Carling Cup final. \"It's big couple of months for Liverpool,\" he added. \"We're fighting for the fourth spot for the Champions League for next season but we are still involved in two cup competitions, which are very important. \"We are confident we can upset Chelsea in the Carling Cup final and get to the last eight of the Champions League because, financially, it is big for the club and, personally for myself, it is very good.\" \n",

      "99.2% Van Nistelrooy set to return  Manchester United striker Ruud van Nistelrooy may make his comeback after an Achilles tendon injury in the FA Cup fifth round tie at Everton on Saturday.  He has been out of action for nearly three months and had targeted a return in the Champions League tie with AC Milan on 23 February. But Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson hinted he may be back early. He said: \"There is a chance he could be involved at Everton but we'll just have to see how he comes through training.\" The 28-year-old has been training in Holland and Ferguson said: \"Ruud comes back on Tuesday and we need to assess how far on he is. \"The training he has been doing in Holland has been perfect and I am very satisfied with it.\" Even without Van Nistelrooy, United made it 13 wins in 15 league games with a 2-0 derby victory at Manchester City on Sunday. But they will be boosted by the return of the Dutch international, who is the club's top scorer this season with 12 goals. He has not played since aggravating the injury in the 3-0 win against West Brom on 27 November. Ferguson was unhappy with Van Nistelrooy for not revealing he was carrying an injury. United have also been hit by injuries to both Alan Smith and Louis Saha during Van Nistelrooy's absence, meaning Wayne Rooney has sometimes had to play in a lone role up front. The teenager has responded with six goals in nine games, including the first goal against City on Sunday. \n",

      "100.0% Tech helps disabled speed demons  An organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  The Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham's NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. \"I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg,\" Mr Tansley told the BBC News website. \"In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device.\" Mr Tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the Autocycle Union. \"At that time they wouldn't let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me I could have a licence as long as I raced sidecars.\" Mr Tansley's invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. \"I'm not prejudiced, I'll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!\" he joked.  Another exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire.  \"We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,\" said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. \"The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away.\" Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  When Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion.  And it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. She uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat. \"But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you'll lose the balance of the car,\" she said. \"I bring everything back to me - steering wheel, steering column, gear lever and pedals.\" When she recently took part in the London to Sydney Marathon she shared the driving with her partner, Trevor, who now does the engineering work. He designed a system for their Morris Minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level. \n",

      "100.0% Robotic pods take on car design  A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.  The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like \"i-unit\" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.  Also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped \"i-foot\". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.  Standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. \"They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production,\" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. \"They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. \"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace.\"  The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota's prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs. While Toyota's prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.  Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.  \"Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,\" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. \"You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.\" Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: \"The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. \"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. \"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri. \"In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. \"This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.\" Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. \"The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,\" said Dr Gillingwater. \"What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. \"Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\" \n",

      "100.0% China 'blocks Google news site'  China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.  The Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.  China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world.  A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.  \"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports,\" said the group in a statement. \"By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing,\" it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. \"It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue,\" said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links. \n",

      "100.0% Games help you 'learn and play'  'God games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research.  A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages. Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.  There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games. \"One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,\" he said. He believes that the \"phenomenal ability\" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. \"The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,\" he said.  By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma. By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word \"energie\" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding.  One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.  Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. \"I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer,\" he told the BBC News website. \"I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish.\" Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change. A report on the experiment said: \"Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.\" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology. \n",

      "100.0% Joy Division story to become film  The life of late Joy Division singer Ian Curtis is to be made into a film, it has been announced.  The Manchester-based production is called Touching From A Distance, after a book by Curtis's widow Deborah which forms the basis for the film. Music mogul Tony Wilson, who headed the record company Joy Division were signed to, will be co-executive producer. The musician committed suicide in 1980 aged 23, shortly before the band were due to go on tour in the US. Mr Wilson, who has remained friends with Curtis's widow and daughter Natalie, who he says asked for his involvement to make the film \"official\". \"People have different ideas as to why Ian committed suicide, so maybe the film will reflect those different views,\" he told the BBC News website.  Plans for a separate Joy Division film had been announced at the Cannes Film Festival earlier this year, but the project did not get off the ground as it failed to get the backing of Curtis's family. Mr Wilson, who was also involved with Joy Division's sucessor band New Order, as well as the Happy Mondays, said he would \"rather not\" appear in the film. He made a cameo appearance in 24 Hour Party People, in which his leading role was played by Steve Coogan. \"I'm not an actor and I did a lousy job playing my part in 24 Hour Party People,\" said the Factory Records founder, who has been associated with the Manchester music scene since the 1970s. \"Film people have a tendency to mess up when they touch music, but I hope this one works.  \"This is much more than the music - they want to do the real story of Ian,\" he said. The film is to be directed by Dutch-born Anton Corbijn, who has made music movies for Depeche Mode and U2. It will be produced by a US production company, while the widow of Ian Curtis will also be an executive producer. \n",

      "100.0% How to make a gigapixel picture  The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands.  The finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.  The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons' image. \"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,\" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. \"We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.\"  The Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.  \"We had to rewrite almost all the tools,\" Me den Hartog told the BBC News website. \"All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves.\" The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days. Following the success of this project, and with promises of help from others, the TNO team is considering creating a full 360-degree panoramic view of another Dutch city, with even higher resolution. \n",

      "100.0% Putting a face to 'Big Brother'  Literally putting a face on technology could be one of the keys to improving our interaction with hi-tech gadgets.  Imagine a surveillance system that also presents a virtual embodiment of a person on a screen who can react to your behaviour, and perhaps even alert you to new e-mails. Basic versions of these so-called avatars already exist. Together with speech and voice recognition systems, they could replace the keyboard and mouse in the near future. Some of these ideas have been showcased at the London's Science Museum, as part of its Future Face exhibition.  One such avatar is Jeremiah. It is a virtual man, which you can download for free and install in your computer.  His creator, Richard Bowden, lecturer at the Centre for Vision, Speech and Signal Processing at the University of Surrey, refers to Jeremiah as \"him\", rather than it. \"Jeremiah is a virtual face that attempts to emulate humans in the way it responds to activity. He is very childlike, he likes visual stimulus,\" he told the BBC News website. \"When he sees children running and laughing and waving at him, he smiles at them. If you ignore him, he gets angry. If you leave, he gets sad. And you can also even surprise him.\" Jeremiah is not actually intelligent. It works on vision, reacting in a preset way to the information provided by a surveillance tracker system. It is not able to talk or to hear you, at least not yet. The Surrey team is already working on Jeremiah's next version, that will replace the human face with an underwater and more interactive creature: Finn the fish. \"I am interested in the interaction, providing the ability of a system to watch what's going on and make decisions based on that,\" explained Dr Bowden.  The research comes at a time when people are having to cope with an increasing number of hi-tech gadgets.  Experts say a much more natural way to interact with these devices, such as a virtual human, could make it much easier to make the most of all those new gizmos. \"If you get up at three o'clock in the morning, and you go downstairs, there are probably two things you are going to do: either going to the bathroom, or maybe you are going to make a cup of tea,\" said Dr Bowden. \"Now if the system can watch your behaviour over time, it can learn this, so it would predict what you are going to do, turn on the lights for you, or, before you even get to the kettle, it could have switched it on.\" You might even be able to tell your home surveillance system that you will be going away on holiday, and ask if it could make sure that the house is secure once you have left. This might sound like a scary vision of an Orwellian future. But it might all depend on the face that is watching you. \"When we put the surveillance cameras in our centre, a lot of people were very unhappy about the fact that there was a system watching them,\" said Dr Bowden. \"But when Jeremiah's camera went in, nobody minded, because although it's still watching them, they could see what it was watching.\" \n",

      "100.0% Online games play with politics  After bubbling under for some time, online games broke through onto the political arena in 2004.  The US presidential election provided a showcase for many, aimed at talking directly to a generation that has grown up with joysticks and gamepads. Experts say this reflects how video games are becoming a mainstream part of culture and society. The first official political campaign game was technically launched during the last week of 2003: the Iowa Game, commissioned by the Democrat hopeful Howard Dean. More than 20 followed suit, including Frontrunner, eLections, President Forever and The Political Machine, which allowed players to run an entire presidential campaign, including having to cope with the media. Others helped raise the stakes during the Bush/Kerry contest by highlighting a candidate's virtues or his vices.  The phenomenon has astonished the forefathers of political games, a handful of multi-discipline games enthusiasts keen to push frontiers.  \"When I started researching political games at the university, about five years ago, I thought it was going to be something that would take decades to happen,\" said Gonzalo Frasca, computer games specialist at the Information Technology University of Copenhagen. \"I must admit that I was the first person to be surprised at seeing how fast they have evolved,\" added the Uruguayan-born researcher, who has so far created games for two political campaigns. Many artists and designers are experimenting with this form of gaming with an agenda in projects such as newsgaming.com. The aim is to comment on international news events via games.  The ability of games to simulate reality makes them a powerful modelling tool to interact with actual situations in an original way.  \"Video games generate strong reactions mainly because they are new, but also because our culture needs to learn how to deal with simulation,\" Mr Frasca told the BBC News website. This was the case with the one he created for a political party in Uruguay, Cambiemos, an online puzzle game that offered a view on how the country's problems could be solved by working together. \"It's up to us to explore what we can learn from ourselves through play and video games.\" Ultimately, Dr Frasca sees games as a small laboratory where we can play with our hopes, fears and beliefs. \"Children learn a lot about the world through play. There is no reason why we adults should stop doing it as we grow up.\"  But experts estimate it will still take at least about a decade until this new breed of video gaming communication become a common tool for political campaigns.  This is hardly surprising, compared to other forms of mass media like the worldwide web. Only a few years ago, most politicians did not have a webpage, while now it is almost a must-have. Dr Frasca said: \"Political campaigns will continue to experiment with video games. They represent a new tool of communication that can reach a younger audience in a language that can clearly speak to them.\" \"It will not replace other forms of political propaganda, but it will integrate itself on to the media ecology of political campaigns.\" \n",

      "100.0% Solutions to net security fears  Fake bank e-mails, or phishing, and stories about ID theft are damaging the potential of using the net for online commerce, say e-business experts.  Trust in online security is falling as a result. Almost 70% of those asked in a poll said that net firms are not doing enough to protect people. The survey of more than 1,000 people reported that 43% were not willing to hand over personal information online. It is worrying for shopaholics and firms who want to exploit the net. More people are becoming aware of online security issues but they have little confidence that companies are doing enough to counter the threats, said security firm RSA, which carried out the poll. An estimated 12 million Britons now use the net as a way of managing their financial affairs. Security experts say that scare stories and the vulnerabilities dogging e-commerce and e-banking are being taken seriously - by banks in particular.  \"I don't think the threat is overplayed,\" Barry Beal, global security manager for Capgemini, told the BBC News website. He added: \"The challenge for banks is to provide the customer with something that improves security but balances that with usability.\" Ensuring extra security measures are in place protects them too, as well as the individual, and it is up to both parties to make sure they do what is necessary to prevent fraud, he said. \"Card issuers will keep us informed of types of attacks and what procedure to take to protect ourselves. If we do that, they will indemnify us,\" he said. Many believe using login details like usernames and passwords are simply not good enough anymore though. One of the biggest challenges to improving security online is how to authenticate an individual's identity. Several security companies have developed methods which complement or replace passwords, which are easily compromised and easy to forget. Last year, a street survey found that more than 70% of people would reveal their password for a bar of chocolate.  On average, people have to remember four different passwords. Some resort to using the same one for all their online accounts. Those who use several passwords often write them down and hide them in a desk or in a document on their computer. In a separate survey by RSA, 80% said they were fed up with passwords and would like a better way to login to work computer systems. For many, the ideal is a single online identity that can be validated once with a series of passwords and questions, or some biometric measurement like a fingerprint or iris scan with a token like a smartcard.  Activcard is just one of the many companies, like RSA Security, which has been trying to come up with just that. RSA has a deal with internet provider AOL that lets people pay monthly for a one-time passcode generation service. Users get a physical token which automatically generates a code which stays active for 60 seconds. Many companies use a token-based method already for employees to access networks securely already. Activcard's method is more complex. It is currently trailing its one-time passcode generation technology with UK banks. Steve Ash, from Activcard, told the BBC News website there are two parts to the process of identification. The most difficult is to ascertain whether an individual is who they say they are when they are online.  \"The end solution is to provide a method where you combine something the user knows with something they have and present those both.\" The method it has developed makes use of the chip embedded in bank cards and a special card reader which can generate unique codes that are active for a specified amount of time. This can be adjusted at any time and can be active for as little as 30 seconds before it changes. It combines that with usual usernames and passwords, as well as other security questions. \"You take the card, put it in the reader, enter your pin number, and a code is given. \"If you wanted then to transfer funds, for instance, you would have to have the code to authorise the transaction.\" The clever bit happens back at the bank's secure servers. The code is validated by the bank's systems, matching the information they expect with the customer's unique key. \"Each individual gets a key which is unique to them. It is a 2048-bit long number that is virtually impossible to crack,\" said Mr Ash. It means that in a typical security attack, explains Mr Ash, even if password information is captured by a scammer using keystroke software or just through spoof websites, they need the passcode. \"By the time they go back [to use the information], the code has expired, so they can't prove who they are,\" according to Mr Ash. In the next few years, Mr Ash predicts that this kind of method will be commonplace before we see biometric authentication that is acceptable for widespread use. \"PCs will have readers built into them, the cost of readers will be very cheap, and more people will have the cards.\" The gadgets we carry around, like personal digital assistants (PDAs) and mobiles, could also have integrated card reader technology in them. \"The PDA or phone method is a possible alternative as people are always carrying phones around,\" he said. \n",

      "99.2% A-listers flock to Gervais sitcom  Hollywood actors Samuel L Jackson and Ben Stiller have signed up for Ricky Gervais' new sitcom, the comedian has told BBC News.  He said they had both seen the scripts and had agreed to appear in an episode each of the sitcom Extras. They join British stars Jude Law and Kate Winslet who have been booked for guest roles. The comic and actor said he had drawn up an A-list of stars he wanted and all had agreed to be in it. \"We wanted actors who had iconic status but that we could also deconstruct,\" Gervais told BBC News.  \"It's not about the zeitgeist. We wanted people who would still be around in 20 years, not just the winner of Big Brother to take part.\" Gervais admitted he was cautious about revealing who would be taking part until they had all signed on the dotted line. But he has met with Stiller and Jackson and they enjoyed the scripts enough to commit to it.  \"I didn't want to start revealing names until it was all sorted because people just mention people who haven't even been asked. \"I have been linked with ridiculous stories recently such as I'm going to be in a remake of 10 taking Dudley Moore's part. I haven't been approached and I wouldn't take it anyway.\"  He said Stiller and Jackson would be playing \"twisted\" versions of themselves in Extras and that the jokes about them \"would sail pretty close to the bone\". Gervais and his writing partner Stephen Merchant are currently refining the scripts for the six-part series, in which Gervais plays a struggling actor who bitches about the stars. Meanwhile, Gervais is gearing up to promote his cartoon book Flanimals which is released in the US in March, around the same time as NBC begin showing the US version of The Office. The film rights to Flanimals have already been snapped up but Gervais is keen for the project to be taken slowly. \"A film will happen over the next three years but I don't want it to be a $50m movie straight away because it is not well enough known and it wouldn't be another Spider-Man or Batman. I would like to do something small on TV with it first.\" \n",

That would leave the Scots as favourites to win the Wooden Spoon for the second year running. \"I have never quit anything in my life, apart from maybe painting the kitchen,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The support we have been given from Murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100%.\" Williams has yet to experience an RBS Six Nations victory after seven attempts and Scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership. But he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with Berti Vogts, recently sacked as Scotland football manager after a poor run of results.  \"How can a German football coach and an Australian rugby coach have anything in common?\" he asked. \"It is a bizarre analogy. It is so absurd that it borders on the humorous.\" Williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure, despite the possibility of a second Six Nations series without a victory. \"That is not beyond the realms of possibility,\" he admitted. \"There's nothing much between the teams, so we could win the next three games or lose them. \"But I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach. \"It helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach. \"We could have won in Paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too.\" \n",

Shanklin was first-choice wing in the autumn Tests, but prefers centre and will face England debutant Mathew Tait. Dragons three-quarter Hal Luscombe takes Shanklin's wing berth. Up front, Mefin Davies plays at hooker, open-side Martyn Williams is fit to start and lock Rob Sidoli replaces veteran Gareth Llewellyn.

Williams, Sidoli's team-mate at Cardiff, is set to win his 50th cap, replacing the injured Colin Charvis after making a quicker-than-expected recovery from a neck disc problem. \"Initially when I had the diagnosis it was a case of trying to get fit for the Italy game next week, but fortunately my recovery has been a lot quicker than we all hoped,\" Williams told BBC Sport Wales. \"I haven't started a game since 1 January and would have preferred to have a couple of games in the lead-up to this, but the good thing with the injury is that I have kept up my fitness levels. \"I feel quite fresh and I just can't wait to play again.\" Williams says he expects a torrid time from an England loose-forward trio of Lewis Moody, Joe Worsley and Andy Hazell. \"They are three top-class players, especially Worsley and Moody. They have been there and done it,\" Williams added. \"They were back-ups behind Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio, but now they have come forward and proved what good players they are - there are no weaknesses there.\" Luscombe gets the nod on the wing ahead of Dragons team-mate Kevin Morgan, who wins a place on the bench alongside uncapped Blues prop John Yapp.  G Thomas (Toulouse (capt); H Luscombe (Dragons), T Shanklin (Blues), G Henson (Ospreys), S Williams (Ospreys); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Scarlets); G Jenkins (Blues), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones (Ospreys), B Cockbain (Ospreys), R Sidoli (Blues), D Jones (Scarlets), M Williams (Blues), M Owen (Dragons).

Edu's deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told BBC Sport: \"I'm not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. \"If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that's made me think.\" Edu's brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal's current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: \"My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.  \"There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. \"Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that's in the best interests of both the club and myself. \"I'm going to make my decision after the meeting later this week.\" Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: \"I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.  \"That's nice, but I've never talked to them, so I can't say they want me sign 100%.\" Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu.

Houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of Benitez since the Spaniard took over at Liverpool. But Houllier told BBC Sport: \"In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. \"Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I've spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him.\" Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.  The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: \"If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. \"It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. \"I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged.\"  Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho's work at leaders Chelsea. He said: \"Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. \"They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose's principles. \"Jose had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly.\" And Houllier, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: \"It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. \"It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. \"Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues.

Rinaldi told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: \"I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano. \"Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. Their interest has been known for some time.\" Adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season. And Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had claimed that he was in Milan talking to Adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. Mourinho said he was \"just practising my Portuguese with him because I don't need strikers\". Rinaldi told BBC Sport: \"I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. \"If they want to, that's fine. I can tell them what the situation is. \"If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer.\" Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of Â£40m on the head of Adriano, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma.

US-based Alistair Cragg and Mark Carroll are the only Irish athletes selected so far for the Europeans who will not run in Sheffield. Brizzel will defend his 200m title in the British trials. In-form James McIlroy will hope to confirm his place in the British team for Madrid by winning the 800m title. McIlroy has been in tremendous form on the European circuit in recent weeks. He is one of the fastest 800m runners in the world this winter and already seems assured of a place in Madrid. Corkman Mark Carroll confirmed in midweek that he would join Cragg in the European Championships. Carroll is ranked number three in the world 3000m ranking at the moment with Cragg occupying top spot. Meanwhile, nine-times champion Dermot Donnelly will not be coming out of retirement to compete in the Northern Ireland Cross Country Championships in Coleraine on Saturday. An injury crisis in the Annadale Striders squad led to Donnelly being entered by coach John McLaughlin but the athlete told BBC Sport on Friday evening that he would not be running. Willowfield's Paul Rowan will go in as individual favourite but Annadale could have a tough job holding on to their team title as Andrew Dunwoody and Noel Pollock are unlikely to run. \n",

The Wasps wing insisted he grounded the ball when he was bundled over the line and said referee Jonathan Kaplan had made a wrong decision. \"I'm positive I touched the ball down over the line,\" Lewsey told BBC Sport. \"It certainly wasn't a turnover. \"I was driven over and I put the ball on the ground. The whistle went and I let go of the ball.\" Lewsey added: \"One of the Irish players scooped it back after the whistle and to our surprise the referee then gave a turnover. \"As far as I'm concerned, that incident and Mark Cueto's effort from Charlie Hodgson's cross-field kick that led to what looked like a good try were the two key elements in the game.\"  Cueto was also puzzled as to why his try had been disallowed by Kaplan. \"I don't think I could have been offside for, without a doubt, I was behind the ball,\" said the Sale player. \"The move was a planned technique, it was not off the cuff.

      "99.8% Radcliffe tackles marathon tasks  Paula Radcliffe faces arguably the biggest test of her career in the New York City Marathon on Sunday.  Back under the spotlight of public scrutiny she will attempt to erase the double disappointment of the Athens Olympics, where she failed to finish the marathon and then the 10,000m. BBC Sport examines the challenges facing Radcliffe ahead of the big race.   The ability to run a gruelling 26.2 miles relies largely upon an athlete's belief that they can do it. Every runner will hit the wall at some stage and see written on it, \"Are you strong enough to finish?\"  The question could hit Radcliffe hard after she was unable to complete her last two races in high-profile and emotional circumstances. Sports psychologist Hugh Richards says the 30-year-old must draw on her past achievements to conquer a potential crisis of confidence. \"There is an old adage, 'get straight back on the horse that threw you,'\" Richards told BBC Sport. \"Paula has got all those great runs in her history as well as the two upsets in Athens. \"She must not lose faith in what has already been proven is a very effective strategy for distance running. \"If she were to change her preparation and tactics that would be madness. \"She wants to start rebuilding her confidence through performance accomplishment.\"   For much of the watching media and public there can only be two possible outcomes in New York - win or lose. If Radcliffe crosses the line first she will have proved her critics wrong. But if she fails to triumph, she risks being labelled a has-been and her profile will suffer. And for any athlete that can have repercussions in terms of sponsorship, appearance fees as well as further self esteem issues.  \"Athletes need to try and stay focused on their internal controls and ignore external questions,\" explains Richards, who has worked with past Olympians. \"She must not get caught up in someone else's agenda.\" Radcliffe's best friend and fellow distance runner Liz Yelling revealed the 30-year-old is already aware she will be exposing herself to more public scrutiny in New York. \"She just thought, 'well, they can't think any worse of me now,'\" Yelling told BBC Sport. \"She's just doing what she wants to do and not thinking about the consequences of it.\"   Radcliffe described her decision to enter the New York marathon as \"impulsive\" but she is certain to have a tick-list of personal goals. Her aims could be as simple as completing a race and making sure she is still enjoying running but Richards says she must avoid more emotional targets, such as redemption. \"You can't change history,\" warned Richards. \"Only one person can win the marathon but lots of people can be successful. \"Paula has to figure out what sort of things will she feel satisfied achieving by the end of the race.\"   The course from Staten Island to Central Park is renowned as one of the toughest in the world. It is also not the kind of fast course that tends to suit Radcliffe better, with the undulating finish through the park testing the legs' final reserves.  Radcliffe has never raced there before and will enter the unknown just 77 days after the Athens marathon. \"It's suggested after a major marathon you take a full month off and start building up again,\" said Yelling, herself a marathon runner. \"But that is only for long-term health and fitness. \"When you finish a marathon you are still very fit and can recover quickly. So physically it is possible for Paula.\" Richards also points out conditions in New York will be more conducive to a strong physical display from Radcliffe. \"The heat stress was the primary factor that tripped her up in Athens,\" he said. \"And that just isn't going to be there in New York, that's been taken out of the equation.\"     Radcliffe concedes she will probably learn a lot from her bad experiences in Athens in time. And Richards and Yelling agree she could turn the trauma to her advantage, starting in New York. \"How you respond to adversity is what marks you out as elite or not,\" argues Richards.  \"One of the challenges of massive set backs is how you turn them into opportunities.\" And Yelling says: \"I think this will probably make Paula.\" \"I think it will drive her on and she'll come out of it a better athlete.\" \n",

France suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. Castaignede told BBC Sport: \"The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England. \"But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road.\" Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world's leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham. &lt;  Castaignede said: \"You can't say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte. \"Had England's kickers not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now.\" Laporte has been criticised for France's negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition's defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. \"All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland,\" said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. \"Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales. But everyone also wants a win.\" Castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the French would go in as underdogs against Ireland.  \"Going to Ireland is never easy but the way they're playing right now, it's harder than ever,\" said Castaignede. \"They're very experienced and don't often lose at home. They've got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.\" Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run-in. \"Ireland have such a good pack but Wales are something else on the break,\" he added. \"At the weekend they were simply awesome. As a Frenchman it was disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. \"Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.\" The 30-year-old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in Paris last weekend. \"Delaigue played really well and admittedly Michalak played well too,\" said Castaignede. \"I'm just glad I'm not the one who has to make the decision.\" \n",

      "99.1% Protesters plan airport challenge  Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.  BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the Â£2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.  The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  The airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. \n",

      "100.0% Tory leader urges Harry apology  Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard.  Mr Howard, whose grandmother died in Auschwitz, said many people would be offended by the prince's actions Clarence House has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume. Number 10 said an error was made but now Harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace. That was a message repeated by Home Secretary Charles Clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie.  But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. \"There is a reservoir of goodwill for Prince Harry, and Prince William with him, in this country, but I think he needs to remember that it can't last forever.\" He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline. Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britain's Jewish community, branded Harry's action's \"stupid and evil\". He told ITV: \"The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust.\" He added: \"I would send him in the army as fast as possible. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that.\"  A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: \"Harry the Nazi.\" Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is.\" Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take. But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology. Mr Clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued: \"He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there.\" \n",

      "100.0% Blair says UK tsunami aid to soar  Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give \"hundreds of millions\" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.  The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt. Mr Blair insisted he had been \"intimately involved\" in \"all decisions at all times\" despite being abroad. He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.  The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.  \"I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.\" The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only \"six or seven million\" had been spent. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. \"My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people,\" he said. Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. \"As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did,\" he joked.  The prime minister took personal charge of the UK's response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day. He also spoke on the telephone to US President George Bush, and the presidents of Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.  Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in \"intensive talks\" with other G8 finance ministers. Germany proposed a freeze last week and Canada has begun its own moratorium. The chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (Â£1.58bn) in repayments. Tory leader Michael Howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been \"playing catch-up\" with public donations.  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week. During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday. On Friday, he will visit the Thai beach resort of Phuket, where British families are still searching for relatives.  International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka. The British public has now pledged Â£76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries. Two ships - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Diligence and frigate HMS Chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. A second Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Bayleaf, is also being sent. UK charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.    - A BBC News Special: Asia Remembered, including the three-minutes silence, will be shown on BBC One and BBC News 24 from 1130 to 1215 GMT on Wednesday. \n",

      "100.0% Tories outlining policing plans  Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.  Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace \"inconspicuous\" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised \"extravagant\" Tory promises on policing.  Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.  Jan Berry said: \"It is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. \"These plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,\" she warned. Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. \"The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"The trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.\" Mr Howard said the authorities were not \"providing the local accountability that we want to see\" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  Critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. \"That is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,\" he said.  Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and \"could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials\". Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a \"minimum policing guarantee\" with their chief constables. A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. He said: \"Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.\" The Tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an American sheriff. Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences. \n",

      "100.0% Tories plan migrant health checks  Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.  A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against \"pandering to prejudice\".  The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. \"It's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. \"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,\" said Mr Howard.  \"I don't think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.\" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims. The proposals include:  - People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a \"high incidence TB country\" will have to undergo a chest X-ray.   - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to \"demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health\".   - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to \"impose significant costs or demands\" on the NHS.   - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a \"case by case basis\".  There is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: \"TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well.\" The government says the Tories are \"a bit late\" to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: \"We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. \"Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.\" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. \"Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.\" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. \"In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,\" she said. \n",

      "99.3% Peers debate Crown succession law  Peers are debating proposals to change the rules governing the succession to the throne.  Labour peer Lord Dubs' Succession to the Crown Bill aims to end the right of male heirs to succeed to the crown even if they have an older sister. The private member's bill would also abolish the ban on heirs to the throne marrying Roman Catholics. The Fabian Society's Sundar Katwala said the change was \"long overdue\" and that he expected a \"warm response\". The political reform group's general secretary told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme there were some \"very out-dated features\" at the heart of Britain's constitution.  \"In 1998 the government said in principle it supported the idea of ending gender discrimination and that it would consult on how to come forward with its own measures. \"We hope they are warm towards it and don't say this is the wrong time.\" He pointed out that it was 30 years since the sex discrimination act and urged politicians on all sides to back the bill. Mr Katwala added: \"This is long overdue. Parliament will have to do it eventually, the government, and I hope all of the political parties, might think this is a very simple thing to have in their manifestos.\"  But he acknowledged that even if the bill did win support, it was unlikely to become law because the legislative programme is likely to be squeezed by the coming general election. He said he hoped the bill would be a \"gentle nudge\" to the government and suggested it would \"demand a response\". The bill, which is in the Lords for its second reading, has been adopted by former chief whip Ann Taylor in the Commons. The rule of succession is regulated not only through descent and tradition but also by the Act of Settlement which confirmed in 1701 that it was for Parliament to determine the title to the throne. \n",

      "99.3% Child access laws shake-up  Parents who refuse to allow former partners contact with their children could be electronically tagged under plans being considered by ministers. Curfews and community service orders were other options which could be used if court orders to allow parental access were defied, Lord Falconer said. The constitutional affairs secretary outlined some of the plans on Tuesday. He denied fathers' activists had forced the changes, telling the BBC \"there is a recognition that something is wrong\". Between 15,000 and 20,000 couples go to court to resolve access disputes each year, although in nine out of 10 separations there is no court intervention.  Lord Falconer told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he hoped voluntary mediation could help solve disputes before they reached court. But he opposed compulsory mediation, saying that it would lead to many people taking part with the wrong attitude. Other plans include:    - Parenting plans to give advice on access arrangements, based on real-life examples that have worked in the past   - Extending in-court conciliation - more informal hearings before contested court cases   - Better access to legal, emotional and practical advice by telephone and internet   - Legal aid changes to give incentives for early resolution of disputes.     Judges can already jail parents who breach contact orders but that was a \"nuclear option\" which was rarely used as it was not seen as being in the child's interests, a spokesman said. The aim of the new legislation was to provide a \"medium range\" of penalties, such as fines, community service orders, compulsory anger management or parenting classes or curfews.  Failure to comply with these measures could result in offenders being electronically tagged. On the possibility of tagging uncooperative parents, Lord Falconer said: \"Tagging may be going too far, but let's have a debate about that.\" Full details of the new powers will not be revealed until a bill is published \"in the next two weeks,\" a spokesman said.  The government's proposals have met with disapproval from fathers' rights groups. John Ison, from the controversial group Fathers 4 Justice, said: \"It is very disappointing. What we have got is a cynical case of recycling existing legislation.\" Jim Parton, from Families Need Fathers, said the new proposals \"lacked compulsion\".  \"We would like to see couples develop a plan and then have it as a source of a court order - then you know where you stand, you know what the minimum access is. \"Otherwise, you see people make agreements which then fall apart.\" Mr Parton said he had been told by Children's Minister Margaret Hodge there was not enough time to pass the bill through parliament before the general election, which is likely to take place in May.  The Conservatives have called for an equal split between parents on access to be made law. Theresa May, shadow secretary for the family, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the government's plans were \"inadequate\" and were \"papering over the cracks of the current system\". She said a Conservative government would bring a \"radical reform\" of the family courts, as well as enforcing a \"legal presumption of co-parenting and compulsory mediation\". \"We want to make courts the last resort, rather than the first resort,\" she added. The government says children cannot simply be divided up \"like property\" when a marriage collapses. The Liberal Democrats have argued for flexibility in deciding access rules, rather than having \"rigid targets\". \n",

      "80.2% Blair congratulates Bush on win  Tony Blair has said he looks forward to continuing his strong relationship with George Bush and working with him during his second term as president.  Mr Bush's re-election came at a crucial time for a world that was \"fractured, divided and uncertain\", Mr Blair said. It had to be brought together, he added, saying action was needed on poverty, the Middle East and the conditions on which terrorists prey. Mr Blair said states had to work with the US to fight global terrorism.  But there was a need to recognise it would not be defeated by \"military might alone but also by demonstrating the strength of our common values\" he added. Solving the conflict in the Middle East was the world's single most \"pressing political challenge\" of the present day, Mr Blair warned. The prime minister also urged Europe and the US to \"build anew their alliance\".  \"All of us in positions of leadership, not just President Bush, have a responsibility to rise to this challenge. It is urgent that we do so.\" Mr Blair also paid tribute to Democrat John Kerry's campaign, saying he had helped make the presidential election \"a true celebration of American democracy\". The election of the US president was significant for the world but particularly so for Britain because of its special relationship, he added. Earlier Tory leader Michael Howard sent Mr Bush his \"warmest congratulations\", saying: \"We look to the president to be a unifying force for those all over the world who share our determination to defend freedom.\" Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy welcomed the fact there had been a quick conclusion to the election, unlike in 2000.  Mr Bush's first task was to \"rebuild a sense of domestic purpose\" within the US, he said. Mr Kennedy said: \"Internationally, it is to be hoped that a second term will see a more sensitive approach to relations with long-standing allies, not least for the global efforts to combat terrorism.\" Lib Dem foreign affairs spokesman Menzies Campbell said a win by Mr Kerry would have given Mr Blair the chance of a fresh start, adding it was almost as if there was an \"umbilical cord\" between Mr Bush and the UK premier.  \"Europeans must hope that his administration will be much more multilateral in character, and that he will act swiftly to rebuild the Atlantic partnership which is so vital to security. \"Iraq will remain an issue of potential division for some time to come.\" Even before the result became clear, Mr Blair was being urged to push for action on climate change at his first meeting with whichever candidate won.  Liberal Democrat environment spokesman Norman Baker underlined the issue of global warming during a Commons debate on Anglo-American relations on Wednesday. Environment Secretary Margaret Beckett has said the US will act on global warming despite George Bush's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol on carbon emissions. Public opinion would force change, she told BBC news. But Myron Ebell, an adviser on climate change to President Bush, has said there would be no change in the US stance and rejected the threat of climate change. He claimed the US was the only country with independent scientists. \n",

      "97.9% Butler launches attack on Blair  Former civil service chief Lord Butler has criticised the way Tony Blair's government operates, accusing it of being obsessed with headlines.  He also attacked the way the Iraq war was \"sold\" to the public, with important warnings on the strength of the intelligence left out. Tory leader Michael Howard said Lord Butler had given the \"most damaging testimony\" he could remember. But Downing Street said Mr Blair should be judged by results not his style.  Lord Butler said Mr Blair bypassed the Cabinet and relied instead on small, informal groups of advisers to help him make decisions. The prime minister's official spokesman said the Cabinet was still used to achieve a consensus on important issues. But he added: \"You cannot, in a modern government, take every decision in Cabinet. It's just not possible.\"  Lord Butler said the government had too much freedom to \"bring in bad Bills\" and \"to do whatever it likes\" and it relied too much on the advice of political appointees. The former cabinet secretary said in an interview with The Spectator magazine: \"I would be critical of the present government in that there is too much emphasis on selling, there is too much central control and there is too little of what I would describe as reasoned deliberation which brings in all the arguments.\" Mr Howard described Lord Butler's intervention as \"very important\". \"This is from someone who was an insider at the very heart of the Blair government. \"It is certainly the most damaging testimony I can ever remember from someone in such an eminent position.\"  Lord Butler's report earlier this year into Iraq intelligence said the government's September 2002 weapons dossier did not make clear intelligence about claims that Saddam Hussein had stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons was \"very thin\". The reason for this is that it would have weakened ministers' case for war, Lord Butler said in his Spectator interview, which was conducted by the magazine's editor, Conservative MP Boris Johnson. He said: \"When civil servants give material to ministers, they say these are the conclusions we've drawn, but we've got to tell you the evidence we've got is pretty thin. \"Similarly, if you are giving something to the United Nations and the country you should warn them.\"  Asked why he thought the warnings were not there Lord Butler said: \"One has got to remember what the purpose of the dossier was. The purpose of the dossier was to persuade the British why the government thought Iraq was a very serious threat.\"  When asked whether he thought the country was well-governed on the whole, he replied: \"Well. I think we are a country where we suffer very badly from Parliament not having sufficient control over the executive, and that is a very grave flaw. \"We should be breaking away from the party whip. The executive is much too free to bring in a huge number of extremely bad Bills, a huge amount of regulation and to do whatever it likes - and whatever it likes is what will get the best headlines tomorrow. \"All that is part of what is bad government in this country.\" Lord Butler's assessment was backed by his predecessor as Cabinet Secretary, Lord Armstrong. Lord Armstrong told BBC Two's Newsnight: \"I agree ... there doesn't appear to be the sort of informed collective political judgement brought to bear on decision-making that those affected by decisions are entitled to expect.\" Liberal Democrat deputy leader Menzies Campbell said he thought Lord Butler's comments were \"well justified\" and Mr Blair's style of leadership was \"corrosive of the whole system of government\". But Labour former minister Jack Cunningham accused Lord Butler of basing his comments on the first eight months of the incoming Labour administration, when he was cabinet secretary. Mr Cunningham told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"Taken together, Robin Butler's comments are partial, inaccurate and cannot be taken as anything other than politically biased against the Labour government.\" \n",

      "100.0% Nat Insurance to rise, say Tories  National Insurance will be raised if Labour wins the next election, Tory leader Michael Howard has claimed.  Tony Blair has said he does not want higher tax rates for top earners but on Wednesday said other tax promises would be left to Labour's manifesto. Prime minister's questions also saw Mr Blair predict that new plans would probably cut net immigration. He attacked Tory plans to process asylum claims abroad - but Mr Howard said Labour had proposed the idea too.  The Commons questions session again saw the leaders of the two biggest parties shape up for the forthcoming election campaign. The Tories have promised Â£4bn in tax cuts but have yet to say where they will fall. Mr Howard pointed to the Institute for Fiscal Studies' predictions that Labour will need to increase taxes to cover an Â£11bn gap in its spending plans. He accused ministers of wasting money on unsuccessful attempts to curb bad behaviour and truancy in schools and on slow asylum processing. It was no good Mr Blair claiming tax pledges were being left to the manifesto as he had given one to MPs on Tuesday about the top rate of income tax, argued Mr Howard. Pointing to national insurance, he added: \"Everyone knows tax will go up under Labour: isn't it now clear which tax it would be?\"  Mr Blair instead hailed Labour's achievement in using a strong economy to invest in public services. \"When we have money not only going into extra teachers and nurses but equipment in schools and hospitals, that money is not wasted,\" he said. On the tax questions, he added: \"We will make commitments on tax at the time of the manifesto.\" Home Secretary Charles Clarke this week published plans for a new points system for economic migrants, with only high-skilled workers allowed into the UK from outside the European Union.  Mr Blair said abuses would be weeded out and chain migration, where families automatically get the right to settle with immigrant workers, would end. That would probably create a fall in the migrant numbers, he said. The prime minister ridiculed the Tory plans for asylum quotas and for processing all asylum claims overseas. He challenged the Tories on which country would house their processing centres - what he called a \"fantasy island\". Mr Howard read from a letter about the government's own plans at the European Council of Ministers for processing asylum seekers outside the EU. But Mr Blair said: \"All the other countries could not agree on the way forward, nor could the UN.\" \n",

      "100.0% Satellite mapping aids Darfur relief  Aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.  A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. \"Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,\" said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium.  The group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. \"You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,\" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre.  This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. \"Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,\" said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. \"A map is a working document,\" explains Herbert Hansen of Respond's Belgian partner Keyobs. \"You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. \"We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected.\"  Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. \"These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,\" says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.

      "100.0% Poles play with GameBoy 'blip-pop'  A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendo's handheld GameBoy console to a new level.  The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed \"blip-pop.\" Think of it as Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook, or maybe Tetris takes on Kraftwerk. Any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys, with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board.  Jarek Kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now.  \"I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine,\" said Kujda. He realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. He wondered, if one GameBoy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born. \"Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project,\" said Kudja. \"We prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert.\" The group plays maybe four or five shows a year. Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise. \"For example, I make music with more hard beats and noises,\" she said. \"But each of us makes another music, a different sound. And then in the concert we just improvise, and that I think is more fun for us.\"  The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. Some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it.  In the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. But Jarek Kujda says they try to be unique. \"We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum,\" he said. \"We want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. We're something like an electronic jam session.\" The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year. And they have sponsorship, courtesy of the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. A GameBoy Advance costs about US $200 in Poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers, or musicians.

      "100.0% Web logs aid disaster recovery  Some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.  Bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. When he created it, the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between India and Pakistan. But in the wake of Sunday's tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.  They wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. \"We started publishing these SMSes,\" says Mr Gupta.  \"Morquendi was describing scenes like 1,600 bodies washed up on a shore, and people burying, and burying and burying them. People digging holes with their hands. And this was coming through an SMS message. \"We didn't have visual accounts on radio or on TV, or in the print media.\" Soon, thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendi's first hand accounts. In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. \"She was being swept away,\" Morquendi's message read. \"She grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. She says she watched the water pull her friend away.\" Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi's text message blogs was palpable. \"He was running around, looking for friends, burying bodies, carrying bodies,\" Mr Gupta says of Morquendi. \"I can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time. \"He was caught between being a journalist and being a human being.\"  Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger who's helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog. She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. \"What we're doing is we're building a resource,\" she says. \"Anyone who says, OK, I want to come and do some work in India, volunteer in India, or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia, this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines, relief agencies, aid agencies, contacts for them etc.\"  Ms Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. \"Imagine if they had this resource available to them, if there was a disaster, how quickly you could funnel aid in, and get people to help,\" she says. Bloggers in the United States are also getting involved. Ramdhan Yadav Kotamaraja is originally from India, but now lives in Dallas. Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. So, he set up an online payment system on his website. Then, says Mr Kotamaraja, the blogging world found out. \"All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. I'd say 70% of the donations came from people I don't know. \"It's simply unbelievable to me, that people that I don't know will come and start donating.\" News spreads quickly on weblogs, a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help. One recruit calls himself Heretic. In one of his latest posts, Heretic asks: \"Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? Ever seen a bus inside a house? \"Well,\" Heretic writes, \"that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?\" He concludes: \"Keep it blogged.\"  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. \n",

      "100.0% Multi-purpose TV aids India  Two-thirds of the world's population, 4 billion people, live on $2,000 a year or less.  You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. But that's not the case. Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. \"I come from a village,\" says Prof Reddy, \"I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.\" \"There, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC, word processing and Powerpoint,\" he said. \"So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.\"  Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?  Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market. The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. \"It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,\" Prof Reddy says. \"People do this today with television sets. If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. Why? Because personalized entertainment has become very important.\" This hatched a completely new idea. He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control.  On the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like TV, voice mail, and video e-mail. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that \"when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' \"It can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing.\" \"The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,\" he says. The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.  Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi.  \"We're looking at the thing you'll see in Starbuck's or many other hotspots,\" he says. \"We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason.\" Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities. Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail. For example, a farmer could use the PCtvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. \"The underlying problem,\" he says, \"is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' \"And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. If I didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. But I have a tool. There is hope. I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before.\"  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production \n",

      "100.0% Text messages aid disaster recovery  Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.  The messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency. Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television. The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi. He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast. Cell phone signals were weak. Land lines were unreliable. So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages. The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \"who needs what and where\". Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders. Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  And that's when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use. \"SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,\" he says.  \"In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages.\" Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi's messages. Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Mr Rampersad said: \"Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. \"He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.\" He added: \"Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.\"  Mr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September. Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.  In only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain. The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. \"This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,\" says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. \"You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,\" he said, \"That's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy.\" It is still very early days for the project, though. In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it \"an early proof of concept.\" Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. But there's still another challenge. You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. \"It's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that,\" says Mr Rampersad. \"So the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication.\" He is optimistic, however. He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating.  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. \n",

      "99.4% Podcasts mark rise of DIY radio  An Apple iPod or other digital music players can hold anything up to 10,000 songs, which is a lot of space to fill.  But more and more iPod owners are filling that space with audio content created by an unpredictable assortment of producers. It is called \"podcasting\" and its strongest proponent is former MTV host and VJ (video jockey) Adam Curry. Podcasting takes its name from the Apple iPod, although you do not need an iPod to create one or to listen to a podcast. A podcast is basically an internet-based radio show which podcasters create, usually in the comfort of their own home. They need only a microphone, a PC, and some editing software. They then upload their shows to the internet and others can download and listen to them, all for free. Using technology based on XML computer code and RSS - Really Simple Syndication - listeners can subscribe to podcasts collected automatically in a bit of software, which Mr Curry has pioneered. The latest MP3 files of shows can then be picked up by a music playing device automatically.  Mr Curry records, hosts, edits and produce a daily, 40 minute podcast called The Daily Source Code. He wants to make podcasting \"the Next Big Thing\" and says it is an extension of his childhood love of radio gadgetry. \"I was always into technologies and wires,\" he explains. \"My parents gave me the Radio Shack 101 project kit, which allows you to build an AM transmitter and subsequently an FM transmitter. \"I had my mom drive me around the block, see how far it would reach on the car radio.\"  Mr Curry is American, but he grew up in the Netherlands where he hosted illegal, pirate radio shows in the Dutch capital. He tried university in the US, and ended up back in Holland where he hosted a music video show. He spent the next seven years in New York where he worked at MTV hosting the Top 20 Video Countdown, but spent most of his hours tinkering with this new thing called the internet. \"At a certain point in 1995, I was driving in on a Friday afternoon, beautiful blue sky, one of those beautiful days thinking, this is so stupid. \"You know, I'm going do the Top 20 Countdown, take the cheque, go home, and sit on the internet until three in the morning. \"So, after I finished the show, I quit. I said, on air, it's been great, I've been here for seven years at that point, there's something on the internet, I've got to go find it, and I'll see you later.\"  But Mr Curry's technology and broadcast interests started to gel a couple of years ago when computer storage was growing exponentially and high-speed internet connections were becoming more widely available. The MP3 format also meant that people could create and upload audio more cheaply and efficiently than ever before.  Most importantly, Mr Curry says, people across the globe were bored with the radio they were hearing. \"Listen to 99% of the radio that you hear today, it's radio voices, and it's fake, it's just fake.\" He wanted to make it easier for people to find \"real voices\" on the internet. He wanted software that would automatically download new audio content directly onto players like, iPods. Mr Curry is not a computer programmer, so he asked others to create one for him. No one did, so he tried to write one himself. He finished it a few months ago and says it \"totally sucked.\" He put it up on the net as open source software and now dozens of coders and audio junkies are refining it; the result is a work in progress called \"ipodder\". Doug Kaye, a California-based podcaster, praises the former MTV VJ for what he has done. \"Adam created a simple script that solved what we call the last mile problem. Ipodder takes audio from the web and brings it all the way down to the MP3 player,\" he explains. \"People can wake up in the morning, pick up their iPods as they go to work or before they go exercise, and discover that there's all this new content automatically put onto their players.\" It is created an explosion in podcasting content and podcasters are springing up in Australia, Finland, Brazil, even Malaysia. One couple broadcasts theirs, The Dawn and Drew Show, from Wisconsin in the US, sometimes even from the comfort of their own bed. Topics range from the comfort of their bed, to the latest films or music and have thousands of listeners.  Already, websites are springing up that point listeners in the right direction of good podcasts.  Chris McIntyre runs Podcast Alley and says that there are good sites out there but that not everyone has the technological know-how to simply listen. \"If I were to tell my mom, or my mother-in-law to copy an XML or RSS file to their podcast aggregator, they would think I was speaking a foreign language,\" Mr McIntyre says. Along with technical challenges, there may be legal challenges to podcasters who air their favourite, albeit copyrighted, music. Some in podcasting also worry that too much attention may turn what they see as the \"anti-radio\" into something that is more like conventional broadcasting. Already there is interest in podcasting from the corporate world. Heineken is doing its own podcast now, and so is Playboy. For his part, Adam Curry's pressing ahead with his own vision of what podcasting should be. He loves doing The Daily Source Code because it is about introducing good music and cool ideas to new audiences. He has even been called the Ed Sullivan or Johnny Carson of podcasting which, he says, \"is a badge I'll wear with great honour. \"To be the Johnny Carson, or Ed Sullivan of anything is wonderful. And you know what? You don't need a hell of a lot of talent. \"You just have to be nice, have your ears open, and let people shine. And that's good for me.\"  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. \n",

      "100.0% Web radio takes Spanish rap global  Spin the radio dial in the US and you are likely to find plenty of Spanish-language music. But what you will not find is much Spanish-language hip-hop.  Hip-hop and rap are actually quite popular in the Spanish-speaking world, but local artists are having trouble marketing their work abroad. But now, a US company is bringing rap and hip-hop en espanol to computer users everywhere. Los Caballeros de Plan G are one of Mexico's hottest hip-hop acts. They have a devoted fan base in their native Monterrey. But most Mexican hip-hop fans, not to mention fans in most of the Spanish-speaking world, rarely get a chance to hear the group's tracks on the radio.  \"You can't really just go on the radio and listen to hip-hop in Spanish... it's just not accessible,\" says Manuel Millan, a native of San Diego, California. \"It's really hard for the Spanish hip-hop scene to get into mainstream radio. You usually have a very commercialised sound and the groups are not really known around the country or around the world.\" Millan and two friends set out to change that - they wanted to make groups like Los Caballeros de Plan G accessible to fans globally.  Mainstream radio stations were not going to play this kind of music, and starting their own broadcast station was economically impossible. So, Millan and his friends launched a website called latinohiphopradio.com. The name says it all: it is web-based radio, devoted to the hottest Spanish language rap and hip-hop tracks. The site, which is in both in English and Spanish, is meant to be easy to navigate. All the user has to do is download a media player. There are no DJs. It is just music streamed over the net for free. Suddenly, with the help of the website, Los Caballeros de Plan G are producing \"export quality\" rap.  The web might be just the right medium for Spanish language hip-hop right now. The genre is in what Millan calls its \"infant stage\". But the production values are improving, and artists such as Argentina's Mustafa Yoda are pushing to make it better and better. Mustafa Yoda is currently one of the hottest tracks on latinohiphopradio.com. \"He's considered the Eminem of Argentina, and the Latin American hip-hop scene,\" Millan says. \"He really hasn't had that much exposure as far as anywhere in the world, but he's definitely the one to look out for as far as becoming the next big thing in the Spanish-speaking world.\" Currently, the Chilean group Makisa is also in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10, as is Cuban artist Papo Record. \"Every country's got it's own cultural differences and they try to put those into their own songs,\" Millan says. Latinohiphopradio.com has been up and running for a couple of months now. The site has listeners from across the Spanish speaking world. Right now, Mexico leads the way, accounting for about 50% of listeners. But web surfers in Spain are logging in as well - about 25% of the web station's traffic comes from there. That is not surprising as many consider Spain to be the leader in Spanish-language rap and hip-hop. Millan says that Spain is actually just behind the United States and France in terms of overall rap and hip-hop production. That might be changing, though, as more and more Latin American artists are finding audiences.  But one Spaniard is still firmly in latinohiphopradio.com's top 10. His name is Tote King and Manuel Millan says that he is the hip-hop leader in Spain. On his track Uno Contra Veinte Emcees, or One Against 20 Emcees, Tote King shows he is well aware of that fact. \"It's basically him bragging that he's one of the best emcees in Spain right now,\" Millan says. \"And it's pretty much true. He has the tightest productions, and his rap flow is impeccable, it's amazing.\" Latinohiphopradio.com is hoping to expand in the coming year.

      "100.0% Dance music not dead says Fatboy  DJ Norman Cook - aka Fatboy Slim - has said that dance music is not dead, but has admitted it is currently going through a \"fallow patch\".  The commercial failure of the latest albums by Britain's two biggest dance acts - Fatboy Slim's Palookaville and The Prodigy's Always Outnumbered Never Outgunned - has been coupled with the closure of many \"superclubs,\" and the folding of three dance music magazines. Last month the Brit Awards announced they would no longer be awarding a Best Dance Act prize, with the Brits committee announcing that \"dance music is no longer where it's happening in music.\" These developments lead some to suggest that dance was finished as a popular music genre. Cook acknowledged that much change in the dance world in the four years since his last album, Halfway Between The Gutter And The Stars, but he stressed this did not mean the dance scene was permanently over. \"Every week when I was making the album, I was reading articles about the demise of dance music - and obviously that affects you somewhat,\" he told BBC World Service's The Ticket programme. \"I personally don't believe it's either dead or going to die, but it's going through a bit of a fallow patch. \"So I think, consciously or subconsciously, reading every week that dance music was dead I would think 'right, scrub that track then'.\"  Although his album sales in the UK are down - Palookaville stayed in the UK top 75 for just three weeks - Cook has achieved recent global success with his beach parties. And event on Brighton sea front in 2002 attracted 250,000, people, while a later one in Rio achieved a crowd of 360,000. The DVD of the Rio set was the biggest seller of that year.  \"With a crowd that big, if the weather's nice, the atmosphere before I even go is so good that about halfway through the first record I think 'I've got them',\" Cook said. \"I'm always really really nervous before the big ones - they had to give me Valium before Rio, because two hours before I was literally just pacing the floor. \"For some reason, especially now I've got a reputation for it, the atmosphere and the joie de vivre that's already going on means all I have to do is play 'up' records.\" He promised more such parties in more locations around the world - despite problems after the Brighton event, which ended in chaos with many revellers finding themselves stranded as transport ground to a halt. One man also died of a heart attack, and a woman fell to her death during the free party. \"We're having to widen our horizons from just beaches, because there's landlocked countries that want to get involved,\" Cook said. \"We're doing Rio at the carnival, at the Maracana, and Sao Paolo - our new gig is famous football stadiums.\"  The DJ admitted, however, that his massive worldwide success had a downside, with intense media interest in his personal life. In particular, he said he had struggled to cope with tabloid intrusion during the temporary break-up of his marriage to Radio One presenter Zoe Ball, after she was linked with DJ Dan Peppe.  \"The tabloid thing has been difficult at times,\" Cook said. \"Especially the me-and-Zoe-Gate - it's quite scary.\" He said that he had been \"determined\" that what had happened with Ball did not affect the album. \"At first I was doing deliberately jolly tunes so that people wouldn't think I was depressed,\" he explained. \"Then I thought, 'that's not right'.\" And he highlighted a bizarre coincidence - that one song written before they split had turned out to have a great deal more meaning than intended. \"I said to Zoe, 'I did this track called My Masochistic Baby Went And Left Me, do you mind if it's on the album?'\" he recalled. \"She said, 'yeah, it's hilarious, because your masochistic baby did leave you'.\" Cook also added that he had some ways of coping with the intense paparazzi pressure, which accumulates at the end of the private road he lives on - where Paul McCartney is a neighbour. \"It's almost like prisoners rattling the bars with their mugs,\" Cook explained. \"If there's a pap at the end of the road, everyone knocks on each other's doors - Paul comes round, and we warn him, because we don't know who they're after.\" \n",

      "100.0% Mogul Wilson backing UK rap band  Tony Wilson, the music mogul who established the influential Factory Records in the 1980s, is to launch a new label - convinced he has discovered his \"third major band\".  Factory were the label of both Joy Division - who became New Order after singer Ian Curtis committed suicide - and the Happy Mondays. Now Wilson believes rap act Raw T - signed to his F4 label, the fourth incarnation of Factory - will \"complete the hat-trick\". \"Suddenly, when Raw T came into my life, I realised they are my third major band,\" he told BBC World Service's The Music Biz programme. The group are set to release their first single on 21 February, and follow it up with an album, Realise And Witness, in March.  Wilson has twice tried to resurrect Factory - which lasted for 14 years before folding - but conceded these efforts had been \"despondent and dismal experiences\". But it has not put him off. \"Of all the things I do in my life the most exciting thing I've ever done, and the thing I have most loved, is being part of a record company,\" he added.  \"The idea of working with brilliant young musicians, and being close to the centre of popular culture, is just the biggest thrill in my life.\" Wilson explained how his son persuaded him to go and see Raw T, but he had initially been reluctant saying he \"detested\" young British people rapping. \"It's always inauthentic, it's always crass, it never really works for me,\" he said. \"I went to see this group, Raw T - which stands for Realise And Witness Talent - and like everyone else in the room that night, we were utterly blown away.\" Wilson believes Raw T could be \"to F4 as Joy Division were to Factory records\".  The story of Factory records - which also owned the legendary Hacienda club in Manchester - was told in the Michael Winterbottom film 24 Hour Party People, in which Wilson was played by Steve Coogan.  Wilson stressed that the independent music scene remained \"as important\" as it had been during the 1980s, when labels such as Factory and Rough Trade proliferated. He pointed out that Franz Ferdinand and The White Stripes - \"perhaps the two most important bands since the millennium\" - were signed to indies. \"I think that is a reflection of how useful and how powerful the indie philosophy is, and how bands prefer it,\" he added. \"They can make more money that way - it's a more generous relationship, and also it's a more understanding relationship. \"I think independents are in a wonderful position at this moment in time.\" \n",

      "100.0% Ferguson fears Milan cutting edge  Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson said his side's task against AC Milan would not be made any easier by the absence of Andriy Shevchenko.  Milan's talismanic European footballer of the year misses Wednesday's Champions League first-leg tie after fracturing his cheekbone. \"It's a loss (to Milan), but it could be worse if they didn't have such quality to bring in,\" Ferguson said. \"How much they miss him I think they'll know tomorrow night.\" Ferguson said Milan's front line would still represent a formidable challenge for his defenders. \"They can play Rui Costa and play Kaka forward. They can bring Serginho in and they can play (Jon Dahl) Tomasson,\" he said. Ferguson's own goalscoring talisman Ruud van Nistelrooy is fit again, but the Scot admitted he was unsure whether to start the Dutchman, who has not played for three months.  \"Ruud is the best striker in Europe. What I have to judge is whether he will struggle with the early pace after being out for so long,\" he said. \"His ability puts him in with a big shout but it is a major decision.\" Ferguson, though, is confident his young players, particularly Wayne Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo, are up to the task. \"We have an opportunity to win this cup this year, no question about that,\" he declared. \"With the maturity we see every week in Ronaldo and Rooney, the return of Van Nistelrooy and the form of Roy Keane, Paul Scholes and Ryan Giggs, we must have a fantastic chance.\" It is a view shared by Rooney, who believes \"if we can get past Milan, we have a great chance\". \"As soon as I knew we were playing Milan, I got excited. Looking at the draw, it is anyone's trophy but we have every chance. \"Hopefully, we can get to that final in Turkey and bring the cup back to Manchester.\" Milan coach Carlo Ancelotti said his team were looking forward to returning to the venue where they lifted Europe's most prestigious club title two seasons ago. Milan beat Juventus in a penalty shootout after a 0-0 tie at Old Trafford and Ancelotti said: \"We are all very happy to return (to Old Trafford) to play in the Champions League and this will give us great motivation.\" Ancelotti said he was aware of the threat United posed to his hopes of Champions League glory. \"It's fundamental that we don't allow them to take control of the game. Our intention is not to adapt to their play but to play our game,\" he said. \"They have great quality in attack, they use the wings a lot and we will have to make sure we stop them.\" \n",

      "100.0% Ferguson urges Henry punishment  Sir Alex Ferguson has called on the Football Association to punish Arsenal's Thierry Henry for an incident involving Gabriel Heinze.  Ferguson believes Henry deliberately caught Heinze on the head with his knee during United's controversial win. The United boss said it was worse than Ruud van Nistelrooy's foul on Ashley Cole for which he got a three-game ban. \"We shall present it to the FA and see what they do. The tackle on Heinze was terrible,\" he said. Clubs are permitted to ask the FA to examine specific incidents but information is expected to be provided within 48 hours of the game. The clash occurred moments before half-time when a Freddie Ljungberg challenge left Heinze on the ground on the left touchline. Henry, following the ball, attempted to hurdle the Argentine but his knee collided with the back of Heinze's head.  The striker protested his innocence - and referee Mike Riley deemed the collision accidental. Ferguson was also upset by Arsenal's overall discipline during the heated encounter between the two arch-rivals and praised his own side's behaviour. \"Edu produced a terrible tackle on Scholes that was a potential leg-breaker,\" he said. \"There were 24 fouls in the game by Arsenal, seven on Heinze, five on Ronaldo, six by Vieira - and it was only his sixth foul that got him booked. Phil Neville got booked for his first challenge. \"I am proud of my players for the way they handled that pressure. \"We have always been good at being gracious in defeat. What happened on Sunday overshadowed our achievement, but then they do it all the time, don't they?\" \n",

They will remember it and next time they come they will be better.\" Ferguson admitted his side were well-beaten by the Turks, a result which meant they finished second in Group D behind Lyon. He added: \"They'll know not to play like that again. We showed a lack of strength. But I have no complaints about the scoreline. \"In the second half we had some good moments in attack. And in that situation, you have to take one chance. \"But we didn't do that, so the game just petered out for us. \"I didn't think it made much difference whether we won the group or finished second and I still don't. \"We could get Inter, AC Milan and Juventus but Bayern, Barcelona and Real Madrid were among the runners-up.

      "98.7% TV calls after Carroll error  Spurs boss Martin Jol said his team were \"robbed\" at Manchester United after Pedro Mendes' shot clearly crossed the line but was not given.  \"The referee is already wearing an earpiece so why can't we just stop the game and get the decision right,\" said Jol after the 0-0 draw. \"But at the end of the day it's so obvious that Pedro's shot was over the line it's incredible. \"We feel robbed but it's difficult for the linesman and referee to see it.\" Mendes shot from 50 yards and United goalkeeper Roy Carroll spilled the ball into his own net before hooking it clear. Jol added: \"We are not talking about the ball being a couple of centimetres or an inch or two over the line, it was a metre inside the goal. \"What really annoys me is that we are here in 2005, watching something on a TV monitor within two seconds of the incident occurring and the referee isn't told about it.  \"We didn't play particularly well but I am pleased - even now - with a point, although we should have had three.\" Mendes could not believe the 'goal' was not given after seeing a replay. He said: \"My reaction on the pitch was to celebrate. \"It was a very nice goal, it was clearly over the line - I've never seen one so over the line and not given in my career. \"It's really, really over. What can you do but laugh about it? It's a nice goal and one to keep in my memory even though it didn't count. \"It's not every game you score from the halfway line.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson sympathised with Tottenham and said the incident highlighted the need for video technology. \"I think it hammers home what a lot of people have been asking for and that's that technology should play a part in the game,\" Ferguson told MUTV. \"What I was against originally was the time factor in video replays. \"But I read an article the other day which suggested that if a referee can't make up his mind after 30 seconds of watching a video replay then the game should carry on.  \"Thirty seconds is about the same amount of time it takes to organise a free-kick or take a corner or a goal-kick. So you wouldn't be wasting a lot of time. \"I think you could start off by using it for goal-line decisions. I think that would be an opening into a new area of football.\" Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger also used the incident to highlight the need for video technology. \"When the whole world apart from the referee has seen there should be a goal at Old Trafford, that just reinforces what I feel - there should be video evidence,\" said Wenger. \"It's a great example of where the referee could have asked to see a replay and would have seen in five seconds that it was a goal.\" \n",

      "100.0% Highbury tunnel players in clear  The Football Association has said it will not be bringing charges over the tunnel incident prior to the Arsenal and Manchester United game.  Arsenal's Patrick Vieira had earlier denied accusations that he threatened Gary Neville before the 4-2 defeat. Vieira also clashed with opposing skipper Roy Keane and referee Graham Poll had to separate them. \"The referee has confirmed that he is satisfied he dealt with the incident at the time,\" said an FA statement. It means United's win will pass off without further intervention from the governing body, whose new chief executive Brian Barwick was in the Highbury stands.  \"I didn't threaten anybody. They are big enough players to handle themselves,\" said Vieira. \"I had a talk with Roy Keane and that's it. Gary Neville is a big lad, he can handle himself. \"They just played better than us and deserved to win.\" Neville admitted there had been incidents before the game, but insisted it had not distracted his focus. \"There were a couple of things that did happen before the game which disappoint you,\" he said. \"Especially from players of that calibre, but it's a tough game and we've been around a long time.\" Neville admitted that he had not enjoyed the match, which was punctuated by fouls and the sending off of Mikael Silvestre for head-butting Freddie Ljungberg . \"I thought it was a horrible game in the first half, and it was not much better in the second,\" he said. \"There is no way that should have happened in a football match.\"  After the match, Keane accused Vieira of starting the row. \"Patrick Vieira is 6ft 4in and having a go at Gary Neville. So I said, 'have a go at me',\" he said. \"If he wants to intimidate our players and thinks that Gary Neville is an easy target, I'm not having it.\" Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson added: \"Vieira was well wound up for it. \"I've heard different stories. Patrick Vieira has apparently threatened some of our players and things like that.\" \n",

      "100.0% Beckham rules out management move  Real Madrid midfielder David Beckham has no plans to become a manager when his playing career is over.  \"I am not interested in being a coach but I would like to have football schools,\" the England captain said on television station Canal Plus. \"I have wanted to do that since I went to the Bobby Charlton school. I'm going to open one in London and one in LA. \"My second passion is charity work - I am an ambassador for Unicef and it gives me great pride.\" But Beckham revealed that his immediate priority was winning the Spanish league title with Real Madrid.  Real slipped to 13 points behind leaders Barcelona with a 1-0 defeat at the hands of Sevilla on Wednesday. Beckham admitted: \"It's disappointing and frustrating to see the results, considering the team we have. \"I would really like to win La Liga with Real Madrid - I have been here two years and we still have not done it.\" In a wide-ranging interview, Beckham also revealed that his sending-off against Argentina - and the resulting media storm - had been the most significant moment in his career. Asked for his worst memory, he said: \"To be sent off against Argentina - it was not for the sending-off but for what happened afterwards. \"I was lucky because I had a manager, Sir Alex Ferguson, who supported me and a strong family behind me but I believe that changed me. \"I believe it changed me for the better.\" \n",

The Brazilian confirmed tempers had flared but could shed no light on reports that food was thrown at United boss Sir Alex Ferguson. \"I saw people being pulled apart, people pushing, pointing and shouting,\" he told Uefa's official website. \"The United players were trying to wind us up about the result but I didn't see any soup being thrown at anyone.\" However, Edu tried to play down the incidents, adding: \"There was nothing that I haven't seen in Brazilian derbies. \"Derby matches in Brazil are worse. I like to play in games like this with this intense rivalry.\" But Edu was highly critical of the ferocity of some of United's challenges during the game, particularly on Jose Antonio Reyes. \"I think we were a lot fairer in the tackles than United,\" he said. \"Reyes was being kicked all over the park - they were beating up the boy and Gary Neville was tackling in such a way that he should have been sent off.\" Following the game, the Football Association said it would look into events in the tunnel. It also charged Ruud van Nistelrooy with serious foul play while Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger has been asked to explain comments he made about the referee. \n",

Premiership leaders Chelsea and the Gunners endured a 2-2 stalemate on Sunday, giving United the chance to make up some ground in the league. But Ferguson said: \"I think what makes it so bad is that both our rivals dropped points at the weekend. \"It was a great opportunity - and we haven't delivered.\" United went ahead through Alan Smith in the 33rd minute before Bouba Diop's superb 25-yard strike cancelled out the visitors' lead in the 87th minute. Ferguson described the result as an \"absolute giveaway\" after United had earlier missed a host of opportunities to finish off the encounter. He said: \"It was a good performance - some of the football was fantastic - but we just didn't finish them off. \"In fairness, it's a fantastic strike from the Fulham player.\" The result leaves Ferguson's side fourth in the league on 31 points - four points behind Arsenal and a further five back from Chelsea. \n",

      "100.0% Volcano drama erupts on BBC One  Supervolcano, a docu-drama about a volcanic eruption in Yellowstone National Park in the US, is among the highlights on the BBC One this winter.  The Â£178m winter schedule also includes the return of Doctor Who and a drama about Angela Cannings, who was wrongly convicted of killing two of her babies. Sarah Lancashire and Timothy Spall will star in the real-life drama, Cherished. ITV also unveiled their festive season on Tuesday, which includes Stephen Fry in a remake of Tom Brown's Schooldays. Supervolcano, follows in the footsteps of last year's Pompei, which drew 10 million viewers to BBC One in October 2003.  The programme merges science, drama and computer imagery to reveal what could happen if Yellowstone - home to the only currently active supervolcano in the world - were to erupt again. BBC Two will run a two-part documentary, The Science Behind Supervolcano, in conjunction with the transmission. Other educational highlights include a documentary about infamous Mongolian warrior Genghis Khan and Grandchild of The Holocaust. Grandchild of The Holocaust, part of the BBC commitment to Holocaust Memorial Day, follows Adrian, 13, on a journey to uncover the truth about what happened to his grandmother in Auschwitz and Belsen.  New drama includes Archangel, an adaptation of the Robert Harris best-seller, which stars Daniel Craig on the trail of Stalin's diaries in Communist Russia. And Sarah Waters' gets her second adaptation on BBC One with Imelda Staunton and Charles Dance lined up to star in Fingersmith. The adaptation, about a conman in Victorian England, will make an interesting contrast to Julie Burchill's Sugar Rush - a lesbian teenage drama part of Channel Four's winter season. On a lighter note, Jessica Stevenson will star in new BBC One sitcom, The World According to Bex, penned by My Family creator Fred Barron and the Two Ronnies return for a celebration of their classic comedy series.  Fry's portrayal of headmaster Dr Arnold dominates a muted Christmas schedule on ITV1, which sees the channel retreat from broadcasting blockbuster movies in favour of extended soap episodes and popular quiz shows.  Sir Paul McCartney, wife Heather Mills and Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson will join a celebrity edition of Who Wants to be a Millionaire? on Christmas Day. Also on Christmas Day, John Nettles will return in a one-off edition of Midsomer Murders, while two episodes of the new Miss Marple drama will air over the festive period. Films on ITV1 include Gus Van Sant's Finding Forrester, starring Sean Connery, and classics such a Mary Poppins, Star Wars and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. In contrast, BBC's Christmas season includes terrestrial debuts of the first Harry Potter film, Shrek and Steven Spielberg's AI, as well as new epipsodes of the Vicar of Dibley and the final Auf Wiedersehen, Pet. \n",

      "111.1% Games help you 'learn and play'  'God games' in which players must control virtual people and societies could be educational, says research.  A US researcher has suggested that games such as The Sims could be a good way to teach languages. Ravi Purushotma believes that the world of The Sims can do a better job of teaching vocabulary and grammar than traditional methods. The inherent fun of game playing could help to make learning languages much less of a chore, said Mr Purushotma.  There must be few parents or teachers that do not worry that the lure of a video game on a computer or console is hard to resist by children that really should be doing their homework. But instead of fearing computer games, Ravi Purushotma believes that educationalists, particularly language teachers should embrace games. \"One goal would be to break what I believe to be the false assumption that learning and play are inherently oppositional,\" he said. He believes that the \"phenomenal ability\" of games such as The Sims and others to capture the interest of adolescent audiences is ripe for exploitation. The hard part of learning any language, said Mr Purushotma, were the basic parts of learning what different words refer to and how they are used to build up sentences. Boring lessons drumming vocabulary into pupils couched in terms they do not understand has made many languages far harder to learn than they should be. \"The way we often teach foreign languages right now is somewhat akin to learning to ride a bike by formally studying gravity,\" he said.  By contrast, said Mr Purushotma, learning via something like The Sims may mean students do not feel like they are studying at all. This was because The Sims does not rely solely on words to get information across to players. Instead the actions of its computer controlled people and how they interact with their world often makes clear what is going on. The incidental information about what a Sim was doing could reinforce what a player or student was supposed to be learning, said Mr Purushotma. By contrast many language lessons try to impart information about a tongue with little context. For instance, he said, in a version of The Sims adapted to teach German, if a player misunderstood what was meant by the word \"energie\" the actions of a tired Sim, stumbling then falling asleep, would illustrate the meaning. If necessary detailed textual information could be called upon to aid players' or students' understanding.  One of the drawbacks of The Sims, said Mr Purushotma, was the lack of spoken language to help people brush up on pronunciation. However, online versions of The Sims, in which people have to move in, meet the neighbours and get to know the local town, could be adapted to help this. Although not wishing to claim that he is the first to suggest using a game can help people learn, Mr Purushotma believes that educationalists have missed the potential they have to help.  Getting a simulated person to perform everyday activities in a make-believe world and having them described in a foreign language could be a powerful learning aid, he believes. Before now, he said, educational software titles suffer by comparison with the slick graphics and rich worlds found in games. But, he said, using pre-prepared game worlds such as The Sims has never been easier because tools have been made by its creators and fans that make it easy to modify almost any part of the game. This could make it easy for teachers to adapt parts of the game for their own lessons. \"I'm hoping now to re-create a well-polished German learning mod for the sequel by this summer,\" he told the BBC News website. \"I'm encouraged to hear that others are thinking of experimenting with Japanese and Spanish.\" Earlier work with a colleague on using Civilisation III to teach students about history showed that it could be a powerful way to get them to realise that solving a society's problems can not always come from making a single change. A report on the experiment said: \"Students began asking historical and geographical questions in the context of game play, using geography and history as tools for their game, and drawing inferences about social phenomena based on their play.\" Mr Purushotma's ideas were aired in an article for the journal Language Learning and Technology. \n",
      "111.1% Robotic pods take on car design  A new breed of wearable robotic vehicles that envelop drivers are being developed by Japanese car giant Toyota.  The company's vision for the single passenger in the 21st Century involves the driver cruising by in a four-wheeled leaf-like device or strolling along encased in an egg-shaped cocoon that walks upright on two feet. Both these prototypes will be demonstrated, along with other concept vehicles and helper robots, at the Toyota stand at the Expo 2005 in Aichi, Japan, in March 2005. The models are being positioned as so-called personal mobility devices, which have few limits. The open leaf-like \"i-unit\" vehicle is the latest version of the concept which the company introduced last year. Built using environmentally friendly plant-based materials, the single passenger unit is equipped with intelligent transport system technologies that allow for safe autopilot driving in specially equipped lanes. The model allows the user to make tight on-the-spot turns, move upright amongst other people at low speeds and can be easily switched into a reclining position at higher speeds. Body colours can be customized to suit individual preferences and a personal recognition system offers both information and music.  Also on display at the show will be the egg-shaped \"i-foot\". This is a two-legged mountable robot like device that can be controlled with a joystick.  Standing at a height of well over seven feet (2.1 metres), the unit can walk along at a speed of about 1.35km/h (0.83mph) and navigate staircases into the bargain. Mounting and dismounting is accomplished with the aid of the bird-like legs that bend over backwards. \"They are clearly what we call concept vehicles, innovative ideas which have yet to be transformed into potential products and which are a few years away from actual production,\" said Dr David Gillingwater from the Transport Studies Group at Loughborough University. \"They clearly have eye-catching appeal, which is in part the name of the game here, and are linked to the iMac and iPod-type niche which Apple have been responsible for developing and leading in recent years - new, different, hi-tech, image conscious products. \"As always with these concept vehicles, it is difficult to see 'who' they would appeal to and what their role would be in the 'personal transport' marketplace.\"  The personal transport arena is taking on a new dimension though with futuristic devices that augment human capabilities. Toyota's prototypes represent the latest incarnation of wearable exoskeletons in a vehicular form that is specially focused on transport. Powered robotic exoskeletons have been the focus of much US military research over the years and Japan seems to have jumped onto the bandwagon with a wave of products being developed for specific applications. With an emerging range of devices targeted towards the ageing world population, care giving and the military, wearable exoskeletons seem to represent a new line of future technologies that meet an individual's particular mobility needs. While Toyota's prototypes are geared towards mass transport, the company says that the vehicles will allow the elderly and the disabled to achieve independent mobility.  Experts, though, are a bit sceptical of their acceptance in this area.  \"Those with arguably the greatest needs for this sort of assistance, now and certainly in the future, are the elderly and infirm people,\" Dr Gillingwater told the BBC News website. \"You have to ask whether these sorts of vehicles will appeal to these groups.\" Design considerations also exist. Dr Erel Avineri, of the Centre for Transport and Society at the University of the West of England in Bristol said: \"The design of the introduced mobility devices is not completely adjusted to the specific needs of the elderly and the disabled. \"For example, one problem that many older passengers experience is limited ability to rotate the neck and upper body, making it difficult to look to the side and back when backing up. \"It looks like the visual design of the device interior does not consider this need. This and other human-factors related issues in the design of such devices are not the only issues that should be considered,\" said Dr Avineri. \"In general, introducing a new technology requires the passenger to change behaviour patterns that have served the older passenger for decades. Elderly users might not necessarily accept such innovation. \"This may be another barrier to the commercial success of such a vehicle.\" Such single-person vehicles may find a relatively small market niche and may be more suited towards specialised applications rather than revolutionising the face of mass transport. \"The concept of personal mobility behind these sorts of innovations is great but they beg a huge number of questions,\" said Dr Gillingwater. \"What's their range? How user-friendly will they really be? What infrastructure will be required to allow these vehicles to be used. \"Overall I think these vehicles pose a number of important questions than provide answers or solutions.\" \n",
      "111.1% China 'blocks Google news site'  China has been accused of blocking access to Google News by the media watchdog, Reporters Without Borders.  The Paris-based pressure group said the English-language news site had been unavailable for the past 10 days. It said the aim was to force people to use a Chinese edition of the site which, according to the watchdog, does not include critical reports. Google told the BBC News website it was aware of the problems and was investigating the causes.  China is believed to extend greater censorship over the net than any other country in the world.  A net police force monitors websites and e-mails, and controls on gateways connecting the country to the global internet are designed to prevent access to critical information. Popular Chinese portals such as Sina.com and Sohu.com maintain a close eye on content and delete politically sensitive comments. And all 110,000 net cafes in the country have to use software to control access to websites considered harmful or subversive.  \"China is censoring Google News to force internet users to use the Chinese version of the site which has been purged of the most critical news reports,\" said the group in a statement. \"By agreeing to launch a news service that excludes publications disliked by the government, Google has let itself be used by Beijing,\" it said. For its part, the search giant said it was looking into the issue. \"It appears that many users in China are having difficulty accessing Google News sites in China and we are working to understand and resolve the issue,\" said a Google spokesperson. Google News gathers information from some 4,500 news sources. Headlines are selected for display entirely by a computer algorithm, with no human editorial intervention. It offers 15 editions of the service, including one tailored for China and one for Hong Kong. Google launched a version in simplified Chinese in September. The site does not filter news results to remove politically sensitive information. But Google does not link to news sources which are inaccessible from within China as this would result in broken links. \n",
      "111.1% Tech helps disabled speed demons  An organisation has been launched to encourage disabled people to get involved in all aspects of motorsport, which is now increasingly possible thanks to technological innovations.  The Motorsport Endeavour Club left the starting grid yesterday at the Autosport International 2005 show at Birmingham's NEC, with several technologies to adapt vehicles on display.  Motorcycle racer, Roy Tansley, from Derby developed his electronic sequential gear changer following an accident which resulted in part of his left leg being amputated. \"I needed to find a way of changing gear and generally you do that with your left leg,\" Mr Tansley told the BBC News website. \"In simple terms, I needed to invent a left foot - initially it was quite a Heath Robinson device.\" Mr Tansley had to argue his case to be allowed to continue competing with motorcycle racing's governing body, the Autocycle Union. \"At that time they wouldn't let any amputee race at all, but eventually they told me I could have a licence as long as I raced sidecars.\" Mr Tansley's invention, the Pro-Shift, is designed to work with Hewland gearboxes which are widely used in motorcycle racing. In addition to helping disabled riders to compete, Mr Tansley reckons that the Pro-Shift saves at least 20 seconds per lap when he competes in the Isle of Man TT. As a result, there has been considerable interest in the product from other riders keen to improve their performance. \"I'm not prejudiced, I'll sell to able-bodied people if I have to!\" he joked.  Another exhibit on the Motorsport Endeavour stand is a Subaru Impreza rally car, adapted to accommodate a variety of disabilities. The vehicle belongs to ParaRallying, the world's only rally school for disabled drivers which is based in Lincolnshire.  \"We use the latest technology supplied by an Italian company,\" said rally driver Dave Hawkins who runs the company. \"The cars have electronic throttles, electronic brakes, electronic clutches - we've yet to turn anybody away.\" Mr Hawkins - a paraplegic himself - says his customers have included right or left arm amputees, quadriplegics, people who have had strokes and a woman who had had all four limbs amputated. ParaRallying uses a Vauxhall Astra GSI with an automatic gearbox and manual Subaru Imprezas. The car on display is fitted with a 'duck clutch' - a switch on the gear stick used instead of the clutch pedal. It also has a second ring behind the steering wheel to operate the throttle and a hand operated brake bar.  When Joy Rainey started competing in motorsport in 1974 she was continuing the family tradition - her father, Murray, is a former Australian Formula 3 champion.  And it was Rainey Senior who modified a sports racer to accommodate his daughter's small stature so that she could take part in hill climbs. She uses an ordinary road car by putting extensions on the pedals, a cushion behind her back and raising the seat. \"But in a competition car you have to have everything right or you'll lose the balance of the car,\" she said. \"I bring everything back to me - steering wheel, steering column, gear lever and pedals.\" When she recently took part in the London to Sydney Marathon she shared the driving with her partner, Trevor, who now does the engineering work. He designed a system for their Morris Minor so that the adaptations could be totally removed in under a minute. The Motorsport Endeavour Club is hoping that putting such technologies on display will result in more disabled people becoming involved in all areas of the sport and at every level. \n",
      "111.1% How to make a gigapixel picture  The largest digital panoramic photo in the world has been created by researchers in the Netherlands.  The finished image is 2.5 billion pixels in size - making it about 500 times the resolution of images produced by good consumer digital cameras. The huge image of Delft was created by stitching together 600 single snaps of the Dutch city taken at a fixed spot. If printed out in standard 300 dots per inch resolution, the picture would be 2.5m high and 6m long.  The researchers have put the image on a website which lets viewers explore the wealth of detail that it captures. Tools on the page let viewers zoom in on the city and its surroundings in great detail. The website is already proving popular and currently has more than 200,000 visitors every day.  The image was created by imaging experts from the Dutch research and technology laboratory TNO which created the 2.5 gigapixel photo as a summer time challenge.  The goal of the project was to be one of the first groups to make gigapixel images. The first image of such a size was manually constructed by US photographer Max Lyons in November 2003. That image portrayed Bryce Canyon National Park, in Utah, and was made up of 196 separate photographs. The panorama of Delft is a little staid in contrast to the dramatic rockscape captured in Mr Lyons' image. \"He did it all by hand, which was an enormous effort, and we got the idea that if you use automatic techniques, it would be feasible to build a larger image,\" said Jurgen den Hartog, one of the TNO researchers behind the project. \"We were not competing with Mr Lyons, but it started as a lunchtime bet.\"  The Dutch team used already available technologies, although it had to upgrade them to be able to handle the high-resolution image.  \"We had to rewrite almost all the tools,\" Me den Hartog told the BBC News website. \"All standard Windows viewers available would not be able to load such a large image, so we had to develop one ourselves.\" The 600 component pictures were taken on July 2004 by a computer-controlled camera with a 400 mm lens. Each image was made to slightly overlap so they could be accurately arranged into a composite. The stitching process was also done automatically using five powerful PCs over three days.

      "219.1% Williams says he will never quit  Defiant Matt Williams says he will not quit as Scotland coach even if his side slump to a new low with defeat by Italy at Murrayfield.  That would leave the Scots as favourites to win the Wooden Spoon for the second year running. \"I have never quit anything in my life, apart from maybe painting the kitchen,\" he told BBC Sport. \"The support we have been given from Murrayfield in my whole time here has been 100%.\" Williams has yet to experience an RBS Six Nations victory after seven attempts and Scotland have lost 12 of their 14 games under his leadership. But he rejected the comparison made in some media sources with Berti Vogts, recently sacked as Scotland football manager after a poor run of results.  \"How can a German football coach and an Australian rugby coach have anything in common?\" he asked. \"It is a bizarre analogy. It is so absurd that it borders on the humorous.\" Williams insists that he is revelling in the pressure, despite the possibility of a second Six Nations series without a victory. \"That is not beyond the realms of possibility,\" he admitted. \"There's nothing much between the teams, so we could win the next three games or lose them. \"But I actually really enjoy seeing how you cope with such pressure as a coach. \"It helps the team grow and helps you grow as a coach. \"We could have won in Paris but for the last five minutes and now we have two defeats, but we were confident for those two first games and we are confident we can beat Italy too.\" \n",
      "219.1% Parker misses England clash  Tom Shanklin will start in the centre for Wales against England in Cardiff on Saturday after Sonny Parker failed to recover from a trapped neck nerve.  Shanklin was first-choice wing in the autumn Tests, but prefers centre and will face England debutant Mathew Tait. Dragons three-quarter Hal Luscombe takes Shanklin's wing berth. Up front, Mefin Davies plays at hooker, open-side Martyn Williams is fit to start and lock Rob Sidoli replaces veteran Gareth Llewellyn. Davies wins the vote ahead of Robin McBryde, who sits on the bench having recently returned to action for the Scarlets following a neck injury.  Sidoli is back for the first time since last season's Six Nations, the Blues second row back to form after a niggling groin problem. Williams, Sidoli's team-mate at Cardiff, is set to win his 50th cap, replacing the injured Colin Charvis after making a quicker-than-expected recovery from a neck disc problem. \"Initially when I had the diagnosis it was a case of trying to get fit for the Italy game next week, but fortunately my recovery has been a lot quicker than we all hoped,\" Williams told BBC Sport Wales. \"I haven't started a game since 1 January and would have preferred to have a couple of games in the lead-up to this, but the good thing with the injury is that I have kept up my fitness levels. \"I feel quite fresh and I just can't wait to play again.\" Williams says he expects a torrid time from an England loose-forward trio of Lewis Moody, Joe Worsley and Andy Hazell. \"They are three top-class players, especially Worsley and Moody. They have been there and done it,\" Williams added. \"They were back-ups behind Richard Hill, Neil Back and Lawrence Dallaglio, but now they have come forward and proved what good players they are - there are no weaknesses there.\" Luscombe gets the nod on the wing ahead of Dragons team-mate Kevin Morgan, who wins a place on the bench alongside uncapped Blues prop John Yapp.  G Thomas (Toulouse (capt); H Luscombe (Dragons), T Shanklin (Blues), G Henson (Ospreys), S Williams (Ospreys); S Jones (Clermont Auvergne), D Peel (Scarlets); G Jenkins (Blues), M Davies (Gloucester), A Jones (Ospreys), B Cockbain (Ospreys), R Sidoli (Blues), D Jones (Scarlets), M Williams (Blues), M Owen (Dragons).

      "219.1% Houllier praises Benitez regime  Former Liverpool manager Gerard Houllier has praised the work of his Anfield successor Rafael Benitez.  Houllier was angry at reports that he has been critical of Benitez since the Spaniard took over at Liverpool. But Houllier told BBC Sport: \"In private and in public, I have stressed I believe Rafa is doing a good job. He is the right man at the right place. \"Rafa is a good coach and a good man. I've spoken to him since he has been at Liverpool and never criticised him.\" Houllier also revealed he is now ready to return to the game after leaving Liverpool in May following six years at Anfield.  The former France boss has been linked with a host of jobs and pulled out of the race to succeed Mark Hughes as Wales national coach. He has been working for Uefa, covering the Premiership for French television and also coaching in Brazil with national coach Carlos Alberto Perreira. Houllier said: \"If a good club comes up at the right time then yes, I am ready to come back. \"It has been interesting to watch games from a different perspective and I have learned things. \"I have been involved in football since leaving Liverpool and my batteries are recharged.\"  Houllier has been impressed with the quality in the Premiership after watching as a pundit - particularly with Jose Mourinho's work at leaders Chelsea. He said: \"Chelsea are doing very well. They have some very good creative players in Damien Duff and Arjen Robben and Didier Drogba showed he can change the face of a game when he came on against Newcastle. \"They have got a good team spirit and are strong mentally. They have shown they can cope with all the pressure put on them because of the expectations and cope well with Jose's principles. \"Jose had results before he came to Chelsea and I think he will have an impact in the Premiership because he manages his team very cleverly.\" And Houllier, away from his brief at Liverpool, has been hugely impressed with the Premiership. He said: \"It is a very exciting league. It is entertaining, goals are scored and teams are always trying to win. \"It has been very interesting to watch the game from a different perspective. \"Games switch from end-to-end and there is more pace to the Premiership than other leagues. It is a very good product.\" \n",
      "219.1% Edu blasts Arsenal  Arsenal's Brazilian midfielder Edu has hit out at the club for stalling over offering him a new contract.  Edu's deal expires next summer and he has been linked with Spanish trio Real Madrid, Barcelona and Valencia. He told BBC Sport: \"I'm not sure if I want to stay or not because the club have let the situation go on this far. \"If they had really wanted to sign they should have come up with an offer six months before indicating they wanted to sign me and that's made me think.\" Edu's brother and representative Amadeo Fensao has previously said that Arsenal's current offer to the midfielder was well short of what he was seeking. And Edu, 26, added: \"My brother is due to come to London on Thursday.  \"There is a meeting planned for 6 or 7 January to sort it out with Arsenal. \"Now I have a choice to stay or go. I want to sort it out as soon as possible, that's in the best interests of both the club and myself. \"I'm going to make my decision after the meeting later this week.\" Edu is now able to begin negotiations with other clubs because Fifa regulations allow players to start talks six months before their contracts expire. The midfielder, who broke in to the Brazilian national side in 2004, admitted he had been flattered to have been linked with the three Spanish giants. Edu said: \"I've just heard stories from the news that the Madrid president Florentino Perez, the Valencia people, as well as Barcelona are interested.  \"That's nice, but I've never talked to them, so I can't say they want me sign 100%.\" Last month Wenger said he we was hopeful Edu would sign a new deal and played down suggestions that the lure of a club like Real Madrid would be too strong for Edu. Edu added that he had been encouraged by Wenger's support for him. \"I still have a good relationship with Arsene Wenger - he's always said he wants me to sign.\" \n",
      "164.1% Adriano's Chelsea link rejected  Adriano's agent Gilmar Rinaldi has insisted that he has had no contact with Chelsea over the striker.  Chelsea were reported to have made inquiries about Inter Milan's 22-year-old Brazilian star. Rinaldi told BBC Sport from Rio de Janeiro: \"I can assure you that Chelsea have had no dealings whatsoever with either me or Adriano. \"Parma and Real Madrid are interested but there's nothing new there. Their interest has been known for some time.\" Adriano has scored 14 goals in 20 Serie A appearances this season. And Chelsea boss Jose Mourinho had claimed that he was in Milan talking to Adriano on the day he is alleged to have held a clandestine meeting with Arsenal defender Ashley Cole. Mourinho said he was \"just practising my Portuguese with him because I don't need strikers\". Rinaldi told BBC Sport: \"I have to say that nobody from Chelsea or any other London club has contacted me. \"If they want to, that's fine. I can tell them what the situation is. \"If Chelsea are interested then they must make an offer.\" Inter are reported to have slapped a price tag in the region of Â£40m on the head of Adriano, who joined them just over a year ago from Parma. Real Madrid view him as a natural replacement for compatriot Ronaldo. But Rinaldi said: \"I cannot give you a price that Inter would accept for Adriano. That's something that would have to be negotiated between the interested clubs.\" \n",

      "52.1% Protesters plan airport challenge  Campaigners against the expansion of Britain's airports have begun challenging the government's plans in the High Court.  BAA's expansion of Stansted Airport in Essex by building an extra runway is one of the most fiercely opposed plans. Opponents say the Â£2bn cost of the new runway could not be met unless cash from Heathrow and Gatwick was used. They said this is illegal under current rules and are trying to block the government from changing legislation. BAA are also owners of the airports at Heathrow and Gatwick. They have said they cannot raise the money needed for the Stansted upgrades from current landing charges. BAA also says it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans.  Groups challenging the plans include Stop Stansted Expansion, Heathrow anti-noise campaigners HACAN Clearskies and the London boroughs of Hillingdon and Wandsworth. Their opponents are also likely to complain there was no public consultation before an extra runway was built at Luton Airport, or when it changed take-off and landing procedures at Heathrow. If the group wins, the government's future aviation plans outlined in last year's transport White Paper could be left in ruins.  The campaigners will say the government did not adequately consider the building of new airports, such as one planned for the Isle of Sheppey east of London. Lord Hanningfield, leader of Essex County Council, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"We are going to the High Court because we want a judge to rule there should be a proper inquiry. \"We want a judge to say there has been inadequate preparation, consultation and thought before the government came out with its Green Paper. \"Then there could be a proper debate nationally about where this extra capacity should go.\" He added: \"Politicians should not decide where runways should be.\" The Stansted expansion, apart from the building of the new runway, would also need to include new terminal buildings to deal with the projected 50m passengers who will use it every year.  The airport is the hub of many of the no-frills airlines operating in the UK. But BAA has said it has attempted to involve communities in any future airport plans. At Heathrow, Gatwick, Edinburgh and Glasgow airports, BAA launched a series of consultations on blight to properties from the proposed expansion in September 2004, which will close next week. BAA is also offering to buy noise-hit properties for an index-linked, unblighted price. At Heathrow, BAA said it was working closely with all interested parties to see how the strict environmental, air quality and noise targets for a third runway can be met. At Gatwick, the company has written to homes and business likely to be affected by any extra runway. \n",
      "69.5% Tory leader urges Harry apology  Prince Harry should personally make clear how sorry he is about wearing a Nazi uniform to a friend's fancy dress party, says Tory leader Michael Howard.  Mr Howard, whose grandmother died in Auschwitz, said many people would be offended by the prince's actions Clarence House has issued a statement saying the prince has apologised and realised it had been a poor costume. Number 10 said an error was made but now Harry had apologised the matter should be left to the palace. That was a message repeated by Home Secretary Charles Clarke who said the matter should now be left to lie.  But Lib Dem leader Charles Kennedy said Harry was in a privileged position and said he should apologise in person. \"There is a reservoir of goodwill for Prince Harry, and Prince William with him, in this country, but I think he needs to remember that it can't last forever.\" He added that Sandhurst would probably be good for Harry as it would teach him some self discipline. Former Labour MP Lord Janner, who is a high profile member of Britain's Jewish community, branded Harry's action's \"stupid and evil\". He told ITV: \"The time has come for him to make a public apology. It is about common decency, of respect to the people who fought the Nazis, to the families of those who were killed by the Nazis and to people who suffered during the Holocaust.\" He added: \"I would send him in the army as fast as possible. I hope that would teach him not to behave like that.\"  A photograph of Prince Harry wearing a swastika armband and German desert uniform at the party appears in Thursday's Sun newspaper under the headline: \"Harry the Nazi.\" Mr Howard acknowledged the prince's apology and said he had no doubt the prince's father and family would have much to say to him privately about the incident. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"It might be appropriate to tell us himself just how contrite he is.\" Mr Howard declined to say what form the statement should take. But former Buckingham Palace press spokesman Dicky Arbiter said the prince should make a personal, broadcast apology. Mr Clarke said he recognised people's concerns about the costume but argued: \"He has apologised and I think we should leave the matter there.\" \n",
      "71.7% Blair says UK tsunami aid to soar  Tony Blair has predicted the British Government will eventually give \"hundreds of millions\" of pounds in aid to countries hit by the tsunami.  The prime minister was speaking publicly for the first time since returning from his holiday in Egypt. Mr Blair insisted he had been \"intimately involved\" in \"all decisions at all times\" despite being abroad. He was speaking before the UK joins a three-minute silence at noon across the EU for the estimated 150,000 dead.  The Foreign Office says 41 Britons are now confirmed to have died in the Tsunami which struck south Asia on Boxing Day, with 158 others missing. Asked about criticism that he did not cut short his holiday, Mr Blair told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: \"I don't think this is a situation in which the British people need me to articulate what they feel.  \"I think they feel - as we all do - shock, horror, and absolute solidarity with those people who have lost their lives.\" The important thing was action and not words, he said, adding that of the Â£50m given by the government so far only \"six or seven million\" had been spent. It would become easier in the coming weeks to assess just how much money would have to be put in. \"My estimate is we will need to spend from government several hundred million pounds. So we will far and away more than match the generosity of the British people,\" he said. Asked whether he had not returned to work immediately because he was under doctors orders to rest, Mr Blair said there was also a story he had been away for plastic surgery. \"As you can see unfortunately I am still looking the same as I always did,\" he joked.  The prime minister took personal charge of the UK's response on Tuesday, chairing a meeting of the emergency committee of ministers that has convened daily since Boxing Day. He also spoke on the telephone to US President George Bush, and the presidents of Sri Lanka and Indonesia. Chancellor Gordon Brown earlier backed a plan to freeze the foreign debts of all the affected nations.  Mr Brown, who was not at the Downing Street meeting, says he has been in \"intensive talks\" with other G8 finance ministers. Germany proposed a freeze last week and Canada has begun its own moratorium. The chancellor said the plan would initially save the most affected countries about $3bn (Â£1.58bn) in repayments. Tory leader Michael Howard also backed the proposals but said ministers had been \"playing catch-up\" with public donations.  Foreign Secretary Jack Straw is to visit Thailand and Indonesia this week. During his trip, Mr Straw will represent the G8 at the international conference called in Jakarta, Indonesia on Thursday. On Friday, he will visit the Thai beach resort of Phuket, where British families are still searching for relatives.  International Development Secretary Hilary Benn will also visit Aceh in Indonesia, as well as Sri Lanka. The British public has now pledged Â£76m in aid with emergency supplies from the British government starting to arrive in the region on three RAF flights in a joint operation with Scandinavian countries. Two ships - the Royal Fleet Auxiliary ship Diligence and frigate HMS Chatham - have arrived in the disaster area. A second Royal Fleet Auxiliary vessel, the Bayleaf, is also being sent. UK charities have also begun chartering planes to deliver aid.    - A BBC News Special: Asia Remembered, including the three-minutes silence, will be shown on BBC One and BBC News 24 from 1130 to 1215 GMT on Wednesday. \n",
      "71.9% Tories outlining policing plans  Local communities would be asked to go to the polls to elect their own area police commissioner, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.  Party leader Michael Howard said the new role would replace \"inconspicuous\" police authorities. He said the new office would not supersede the job of a chief constable. The Lib Dems said the plan could let extreme groups run policing, while Labour criticised \"extravagant\" Tory promises on policing.  Responding to the plans, the chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, which represents rank and file officers, said it was essential operational independence was retained.  Jan Berry said: \"It is a service, not a political football to be kicked around every time an election approaches. \"These plans could result in those with extreme political views dictating what actually happens on the ground,\" she warned. Outlining his crime manifesto, Mr Howard said elected police commissioners would be more accountable than police authorities which are made up of local councillors and magistrates. \"The commissioner will have the powers which existing police authorities have,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. \"The trouble is, and it's no reflection on the people who are on the police authority - they are good people - but hardly anyone knows who they are.\" Mr Howard said the authorities were not \"providing the local accountability that we want to see\" and that elected police commissioners would be more visible.  Critics fear the move could hand control of the police to single-issue campaigners who would ignore the needs of the wider community. Lord Harris, who sits on the executive of Association of Police Authorities, said the plans seemed to suggest chief constables should be told what to do by a single politician. \"That is overturning nearly 200 years of the way in which we have organised policing in this country to avoid the politicisation of policing decisions,\" he said.  Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten said the plan was dangerous and \"could create conflict between chief constables and elected officials\". Mr Oaten said local people had too little control over policing but a far better solution would be for elected councillors to draw up a \"minimum policing guarantee\" with their chief constables. A Labour Party spokesman criticised Michael Howard's record, saying police numbers had fallen by 1,132 when he was home secretary. He said: \"Today the Tories are making more extravagant promises on the police without making clear how they would pay for them, other than through fantasy savings to the asylum system.\" The Tories insists the commissioner role would not be like that of an American sheriff. Other Tory law and order plans include building more prisons and making criminals serve full jail sentences. \n",
      "72.0% Tories plan migrant health checks  Non-European Union citizens wanting to work in the UK will have to undergo tests for Tuberculosis and HIV, under plans unveiled by the Conservatives.  A positive test for TB would mean visa applications being turned down, while HIV would be dealt with case by case. Leader Michael Howard said the checks on new arrivals would help protect public health and the NHS. Labour said many tests were already done. The Lib Dems warned both parties against \"pandering to prejudice\".  The proposals, which would be brought in if the Conservatives won the General Election, would not apply to people coming to the UK for less than six months unless they intended to work in health or childcare or teaching. Mr Howard said the plans were based on policies already in action in Canada, New Zealand and Australia. \"It's very important that we should safeguard the good standards of public health that Britain enjoys,\" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Government figures suggest TB in England has increased by 25% over the past 10 years. \"Nearly two thirds of people with TB are born abroad,\" said Mr Howard.  \"I don't think a responsible government can stand aside and do nothing in the face of this problem.\" But Mr Howard said the plans would not affect asylum applicants' claims. The proposals include:  - People coming to the UK from outside the EU for between six and 12 months from a \"high incidence TB country\" will have to undergo a chest X-ray.   - People coming to settle in the UK permanently from outside the EU will have to \"demonstrate they have an acceptable standard of health\".   - They will also have to show they are unlikely to be a danger to public health and are unlikely to \"impose significant costs or demands\" on the NHS.   - The tests will include a health check, chest X-rays for TB (except for children and pregnant women) and tests for hepatitis and HIV for over 16-year-olds. Only the discovery of TB will mean people will be automatically denied a visa, other conditions will be dealt with on a \"case by case basis\".  There is already some screening in place. Last year 185,000 people were tested for TB at Heathrow and Gatwick airports, only about 200 were found to be infected. And Dr John Moore-Gillon, of the British Lung Foundation, said: \"TB is not simply imported, we are seeing a rise in many sections of the UK-born population as well.\" The government says the Tories are \"a bit late\" to the issue. Immigration minister Des Browne quoted its five-year plan for immigration and asylum, as saying: \"We are implementing our existing powers by targeted health screening for TB in high-risk areas at the entry clearance stage. \"Those who are diagnosed would then need to seek treatment at home before being allowed to enter the UK.\" Meanwhile Mark Oaten, Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman, said: \"This is another worrying step in the war of words over asylum and immigration between Labour and the Conservatives. \"Michael Howard knows perfectly well what bigger game he is playing, and history proves it is a very dangerous one.\" Lisa Power, head of policy at Aids charity the Terrence Higgins Trust said the policy was prejudice-based rather than evidence-based. \"In fact, it would be more likely to drive people with health conditions to falsify tests while others gain entry by simple dint of their EU status,\" she said. \n",

      "100.1% Satellite mapping aids Darfur relief  Aid workers trying to house, feed and clothe millions of homeless refugees in the Sudanese region of Darfur are getting a helping hand from advanced mapping technology.  A European consortium of companies and university groups known as Respond is working to provide accurate and up to date maps. The aim is to overcome some of the huge logistical challenges in getting supplies to where they are needed. Respond is using satellite imagery to produce accurate maps that can be used in the field rapidly. \"Respond has produced very detailed maps for example for the road networks, for the rivers and for the villages, to more large-scale maps useful for very general planning purposes,\" said Einar Bjorgo from Unosat, the UN satellite mapping organisation that is part of the Respond consortium.  The group uses satellites from Nasa, the European Space Agency and the Disaster Monitoring Constellation. The satellite data is transmitted to ground stations. From there, the information makes its way to Respond organisations that specialise in interpreting such data. \"You have to convert the data into images, then the interpreter has to convert all this into crisis, damage, or situation maps,\" said Stefan Voigt, who works in the remote sensing department of one of those organisations, the German Aerospace Centre.  This kind of detailed analysis usually takes a couple of months but Respond gets it done in about 12 hours. \"Our users are usually not so much familiar with reading satellite imagery, reading satellite maps, so it's our task to transfer the data into information that non-technical people can read and understand easily and very, very efficiently,\" said Mr Voigt. Respond supplies maps to aid groups via the web, and on compact disc. But the best map is one you can hold in your hands, especially in remote areas where internet connections and laptops are scarce. \"A map is a working document,\" explains Herbert Hansen of Respond's Belgian partner Keyobs. \"You need to use it, you need to write on it, correct, give feedback and so on, so you need paper to write on. \"We print maps, we laminate the maps, we encapsulate the maps if needed so you can take a shower with the map, it's completely protected.\"  Humanitarian groups in Darfur have been making good use of Respond's maps. They have come in especially handy during Sudan's rainy season, when normally dry riverbeds, or wadis, became flooded. \"These wadis had a very small amount of flooding, generally, in terms of depth, but greatly impeded the transport capabilities and capacities of the humanitarian groups on the ground,\" says Stephen Candillon of Respond imaging partner Sertit. Respond's rapid imaging has allowed aid groups to find ways around the wadis, allowing then to mark on their maps which roads were washed out at which times. Aid groups say that combination of satellite technology and on-the-ground observation helped keep relief flowing to those who needed it.

      "100.1% Poles play with GameBoy 'blip-pop'  A group of artists in Poland has taken the cacophony of blips, boops and beeps created as players bash buttons on Nintendo's handheld GameBoy console to a new level.  The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project has taken the game sounds to put together music tunes they have dubbed \"blip-pop.\" Think of it as Donkey Kong meets Norman Cook, or maybe Tetris takes on Kraftwerk. Any way you slice it, the sound is distinct. All the sounds are made by six Nintendo GameBoys, with a mixture of older models and newer Advance SP handhelds. The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project tweaks the software a bit, and then connects the units through a mixing board.  Jarek Kujda, one of the project's founding members has been into electronic music and video games, for a while now.  \"I was playing some experimental music and three, four years ago when I first used a GameBoy in my band as a drum machine,\" said Kujda. He realised that the console could be used as a rudimentary synthesizer. He wondered, if one GameBoy can make music, what would happen if he put six of them together? Kujda found five other people who were interested and the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project was born. \"Gameboyzz Orchestra Project is more of an improvisational project,\" said Kudja. \"We prepare some patterns before a concert, and then improvise during the concert.\" The group plays maybe four or five shows a year. Malgorzata Kujda, Jarek's younger sister and a fellow band member, describes a Gameboyzz Orchestra Project concert as a lot of noise. \"For example, I make music with more hard beats and noises,\" she said. \"But each of us makes another music, a different sound. And then in the concert we just improvise, and that I think is more fun for us.\"  The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project admits they get mixed reactions from audiences. Some love the group's music, and others are not quite sure what to make of it.  In the world of electronic music, these purveyors of blip-pop are not unique. But Jarek Kujda says they try to be unique. \"We have lots of people making music on old school stuff, electronic old school stuff like Commodore, Atari, Spectrum,\" he said. \"We want to play only experimental music, not cover songs. We're something like an electronic jam session.\" The Gameboyzz Orchestra Project's tracks are available online and the group hopes to make a CD next year. And they have sponsorship, courtesy of the Polish distributor of Nintendo products. The members of the Gameboyzz Orchestra Project do not expect serious competition anytime soon. A GameBoy Advance costs about US $200 in Poland these days, which is still way beyond the reach of most Polish gamers, or musicians.

      "99.4% Web logs aid disaster recovery  Some of the most vivid descriptions of the devastation in southern Asia are on the internet - in the form of web logs or blogs.  Bloggers have been offering snapshots of information from around the region and are also providing some useful information for those who want to help. Indian writer Rohit Gupta edits a group blog called Dogs without Borders. When he created it, the site was supposed to be a forum to discuss relations between India and Pakistan. But in the wake of Sunday's tsunami, Mr Gupta and his fellow bloggers switched gears.  They wanted to blog the tsunami and its aftermath. One Sri Lankan blogger in the group goes by the online name Morquendi. With internet service disrupted by the tsunami, Morquendi started sending SMS text messages via cell phone from the affected areas of Sri Lanka. \"We started publishing these SMSes,\" says Mr Gupta.  \"Morquendi was describing scenes like 1,600 bodies washed up on a shore, and people burying, and burying and burying them. People digging holes with their hands. And this was coming through an SMS message. \"We didn't have visual accounts on radio or on TV, or in the print media.\" Soon, thousands of web users around the world were logging on to read Morquendi's first hand accounts. In one message, Morquendi wrote about a Sri Lankan woman who was running home with a friend when the wave hit. \"She was being swept away,\" Morquendi's message read. \"She grabbed a tree with one hand and her friend with the other. She says she watched the water pull her friend away.\" Mr Gupta says the power of Morquendi's text message blogs was palpable. \"He was running around, looking for friends, burying bodies, carrying bodies,\" Mr Gupta says of Morquendi. \"I can't even begin to imagine the psychological state he was in when he was sending us reports, and doing the relief work at the same time. \"He was caught between being a journalist and being a human being.\"  Others blogs are helping to spread information about relief efforts. Dina Mehta is an Indian blogger who's helping with the newly created South East Asia Earthquake and Tsunami Blog. She says the blog is not meant to be filled with first person accounts. \"What we're doing is we're building a resource,\" she says. \"Anyone who says, OK, I want to come and do some work in India, volunteer in India, or in Sri Lanka or Malaysia, this is the sort of one-stop-shop that they can come to for all sorts of resources - emergency help lines, relief agencies, aid agencies, contacts for them etc.\"  Ms Mehta also says she wishes that governments in the region would realise the power of blogs. \"Imagine if they had this resource available to them, if there was a disaster, how quickly you could funnel aid in, and get people to help,\" she says. Bloggers in the United States are also getting involved. Ramdhan Yadav Kotamaraja is originally from India, but now lives in Dallas. Mr Kotamaraja wanted to help those affected by the tsunami by pooling money with concerned friends. So, he set up an online payment system on his website. Then, says Mr Kotamaraja, the blogging world found out. \"All my blogger friends started linking up my site, and I saw a lot of people other than my friends. I'd say 70% of the donations came from people I don't know. \"It's simply unbelievable to me, that people that I don't know will come and start donating.\" News spreads quickly on weblogs, a phenomenon that helps bloggers expand their audience and scope. In Sri Lanka, blogger Morquendi is recruiting others to help. One recruit calls himself Heretic. In one of his latest posts, Heretic asks: \"Have you ever seen fishing trawlers on the road? Ever seen a bus inside a house? \"Well,\" Heretic writes, \"that was just the least affected areas - so you can just imagine - or can you?\" He concludes: \"Keep it blogged.\"  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. \n",

You might think that the last thing on their minds would be getting a television set or a computer. But that's not the case. Many people in the developing world give up one of their daily meals so they can afford to buy a TV. And now, an Indian-born computer engineer thinks he's come up with a way to give them cheap access to the internet. Carnegie Mellon Professor Raj Reddy has spent the bulk of his professional career trying to find ways to make technology accessible to poor people. The first step is to figure out why poor people would want a personal computer and Professor Reddy thinks he has a pretty good idea of why they might. \"I come from a village,\" says Prof Reddy, \"I know what the population is like, many of them are illiterate, and many of them have other concerns.\" \"There, nobody will use it for the conventional uses of a PC, word processing and Powerpoint,\" he said. \"So it's clear to me that if people wanted to use PCs in a village - it has to usable by illiterate people and it must be primarily for entertainment, education, telemedicine, and access to expert advice.\"  Prof Reddy also thinks that tying it into some kind of aid package was the wrong approach. After all, he asked -- what aid group could possibly give expensive computers to 250 million less fortunate Indians, let alone the billions of poor people around the world?  Instead, Prof Reddy decided to think of those 250 million Indians as a potential market. The problem then becomes one of making the product compelling enough. \"It must be so compelling that you would give up your third meal in order to have this,\" Prof Reddy says. \"People do this today with television sets. If you go to India, and many other countries, they will first go get a television set before they worry about one more meal. Why? Because personalized entertainment has become very important.\" This hatched a completely new idea. He calls it a PCtvt - A personal computer, television and telephone all in one that runs on a normal desktop machine. Literate users can surf through the applications with a keyboard and mouse but illiterate users can use what looks like a television remote control.  On the screen, pictures - not words - designate applications like TV, voice mail, and video e-mail. This dependence on graphics, video and audio means that a computer for an illiterate person needs 100 times more power and more memory than one for a PhD. Prassana Rambathla, one of Prof Reddy's graduate students, says that \"when you're talking illiterate you're talking audio and video, and that demands exponentially high bandwidth.' \"It can't choke at any point in time, and it has to withstand anything no matter what you're pressing.\" \"The major part is making it foolproof, very tough, so that it never breaks,\" he says. The Carnegie Mellon team says this project is only possible because PCs are now so much cheaper and have built-in audio and video hardware and software. Limited trials of the PCtvt are due to start this month in the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.  Although Andhra Pradesh has a fairly good infrastructure but work has to be done to ensure reliable connections to the net. Prof Reddy has teamed up with Eric Brewer at the University of California at Berkeley. The answer, says Prof Brewer, is wi-fi.  \"We're looking at the thing you'll see in Starbuck's or many other hotspots,\" he says. \"We're doing a lot of work on long-distance wireless and how to make the network work better in the presence of intermittency, when the power goes up and down, and the links go up and down, and the computers you're connected to just get turned off for no reason.\" Prof Reddy says he hopes to lease the PCtvts for about $10 a month, and thinks Indians will rent the units for the television and DVD capabilities. Reddy says he can then introduce the PCtvt's other technologies - such as video mail. For example, a farmer could use the PCtvt's webcam to send a picture of a harmful insect to a local official who could send back a proposed course of action to the farmer. Prof Reddy thinks this kind of communication is the real pay-off. \"The underlying problem,\" he says, \"is how you can increase their wealth and reduce their poverty and reduce their illiteracy, and improve their health care.' \"And what I'm postulating is that this is the technology that will enable them. If I didn't have it, it would be an uphill battle. Even with the technology it's an uphill battle. But I have a tool. There is hope. I can reach them in ways that have not been possible before.\"  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production \n",
      "97.6% Text messages aid disaster recovery  Text messaging technology was a valuable communication tool in the aftermath of the tsunami disaster in Asia.  The messages can get through even when the cell phone signal is too weak to sustain a spoken conversation. Now some are studying how the technology behind SMS could be better used during an emergency. Sanjaya Senanayake works for Sri Lankan television. The blogging world, though, might know him better by his online name, Morquendi. He was one of the first on the scene after the tsunami destroyed much of the Sri Lankan coast. Cell phone signals were weak. Land lines were unreliable. So Mr Senanayake started sending out text messages. The messages were not just the latest news they were also an on-the-ground assessment of \"who needs what and where\". Blogging friends in India took Mr Senanayake's text messages and posted them on a weblog called Dogs without Borders. Thousands around the world followed the story that unfolded in the text messages that he sent.  And that's when Mr Senanayake started to wonder if SMS might be put to more practical use. \"SMS networks can handle so much more traffic than the standard mobile phone call or the land line call,\" he says.  \"In every rural community, there's at least one person who has access to a mobile phone, or has a mobile phone, and can receive messages.\" Half a world away, in the Caribbean nation of Trinidad and Tobago, Taran Rampersad read Morquendi's messages. Mr Rampersad, who used to work in the military, knew how important on the ground communication can be in times of disaster. He wondered if there might be a way to automatically centralise text messages, and then redistribute them to agencies and people who might be able to help. Mr Rampersad said: \"Imagine if an aid worker in the field spotted a need for water purification tablets, and had a central place to send a text message to that effect. \"He can message the server, so the server can send out an e-mail message and human or machine moderators can e-mail aid agencies and get it out in the field.\" He added: \"Or, send it at the same time to other people who are using SMS in the region, and they might have an excess of it, and be able to shift supplies to the right places.\"  Mr Rampersad and others had actually been thinking about such a system since Hurricane Ivan ravaged the Caribbean and the southern United States last September. Last week, he sent out e-mail messages asking for help in creating such a system for Asia.  In only 72 hours, he found Dan Lane, a text message guru living in Britain. The pair, along with a group of dedicated techies, are creating what they call the Alert Retrieval Cache. The idea is to use open-source software - software can be used by anyone without commercial restraint - and a far-flung network of talent to create a system that links those in need with those who can help. \"This is a classic smart mobs situation where you have people self-organizing into a larger enterprise to do things that benefit other people,\" says Paul Saffo, a director at the California-based Institute for the Future. \"You may be halfway around the world from someone, but in cyberspace you're just one click or one e-mail away,\" he said, \"That's put a whole new dimension on disaster relief and recovery, where often people halfway around the world can be more effective in making something happen precisely because they're not right on top of the tragedy.\" It is still very early days for the project, though. In an e-mail, Dan Lane calls it \"an early proof of concept.\" Right now, the Alert Retrieval Cache can only take a text message and automatically upload it to a web-page, or distribute it to an e-mail list. In the near future, the group says it hopes to take in messages from people in affected areas, and use human moderators to take actions based on the content of those messages. But there's still another challenge. You have to get people to know that the system is there for them to use. \"It's amazing how difficult it is to find someone to pass it along to, and say, look this is what we're trying to do and everything like that,\" says Mr Rampersad. \"So the big problem right now is the same problem we're trying to solve - human communication.\" He is optimistic, however. He thinks that the Alert Retrieval Cache is an idea whose time has come and he hopes governments, too, will sit up and take notice. And he stands by his motto, courtesy of Michelangelo: criticise by creating.  Clark Boyd is technology correspondent for The World, a BBC World Service and WGBH-Boston co-production. \n",

      "76.4% Pavey focuses on indoor success  Jo Pavey will miss January's View From Great Edinburgh International Cross Country to focus on preparing for the European Indoor Championships in March.  The 31-year-old was third behind Hayley Yelling and Justyna Bak in last week's European Cross Country Championships but she prefers to race on the track. \"It was great winning bronze but I'm wary of injuries and must concentrate on the indoor season,\" she said. \"Because of previous injuries I don't even run up hills in training.\" Pavey, who came fifth in the 5,000m at the Athens Olympics, helped the British cross country team win the team silver medal in Heringsdorf last week. She is likely to start her 3,000m season with a race in either Boston or Stuttgart at the end of January. \n",
      "82.2% Radcliffe yet to answer GB call  Paula Radcliffe has been granted extra time to decide whether to compete in the World Cross-Country Championships.  The 31-year-old is concerned the event, which starts on 19 March in France, could upset her preparations for the London Marathon on 17 April. \"There is no question that Paula would be a huge asset to the GB team,\" said Zara Hyde Peters of UK Athletics. \"But she is working out whether she can accommodate the worlds without too much compromise in her marathon training.\" Radcliffe must make a decision by Tuesday - the deadline for team nominations. British team member Hayley Yelling said the team would understand if Radcliffe opted out of the event. \"It would be fantastic to have Paula in the team,\" said the European cross-country champion. \"But you have to remember that athletics is basically an individual sport and anything achieved for the team is a bonus. \"She is not messing us around. We all understand the problem.\" Radcliffe was world cross-country champion in 2001 and 2002 but missed last year's event because of injury. In her absence, the GB team won bronze in Brussels. \n",
      "80.7% El Guerrouj targets cross country  Double Olympic champion Hicham El Guerrouj is set to make a rare appearance at the World Cross Country Championships in France.  But the Moroccan, who has not raced over cross country for 15 years, will not decide until two weeks before the event which starts on 19 March. \"If I am to compete in it, it is only if I feel I can win,\" said the 30-year-old, who is retiring in 2006. \"Otherwise there is not much point in me going.\" El Guerrouj achieved a lifetime ambition last August when he clinched his first Olympic titles over 1500m and 5,000m. But the four-time world 1500m champion is still hungry for more success before calling time on his career. The 30-year-old has set his sights on clinching the world 5,000m crown in Helsinki this summer. And he is aiming to break 10,000m Olympic champion Kenenisa Bekele's 5,000m and 10,000m world records.  El Guerrouj could meet Bekele in March as the Ethiopian is the defending world cross country champion over both the long and short courses. But the Moroccan will not commit himself to the St Galmier event until he assesses how well his winter training is going. \"The return to training was very difficult because I accepted a lot of invitations these past few months,\" said El Guerrouj. \"I am almost a month behind but I am on the right track.\"    - Britain's Paula Radcliffe has also not ruled out competing in the World Cross Country Championships. \"I haven't quite decided what events I will compete in prior to London but the World Cross Country is an event which is also special to me and is a definite possibility,\" said the two-time champion. \n",
      "85.4% Kenya lift Chepkemei's suspension  Kenya's athletics body has reversed a ban on marathon runner Susan Chepkemei after she made an official apology.  Athletics Kenya (AK) had suspended the two-time London Marathon runner-up for failing to turn up to a cross-country team training camp in Embu. \"We have withdrawn the ban. Chepkemei has given a reason for her absence,\" said AK chief Isaiah Kiplagat. \"She explained she had a contract with the organisers of the race in Puerto Rice and we have accepted her apology.\"  The Kenyan coaching team will now decide whether Chepkemei can be included in the team for this month's world cross country championships. The 29-year-old would be a strong contender at the event in France and is hopeful she will be granted a place in the 32-strong squad. \"I am satisfied that the whole saga has been brought to an end,\" Chepkemei said. \"I am ready and prepared to represent my country. \"I will be disappointed if I am not given a chance to compete at the world cross country championships.\" AK had insisted it was making an example of Chepkemei by banning her from competition until the end of 2005. But the organisation came under intense international and domestic pressure to reverse its decision. The 29-year-old took part in the 2002 and 2003 London Marathons and was edged out by Radcliffe in an epic New York Marathon contest last year.  The two-time world half-marathon silver medallist will be back to challenge Radcliffe at this year's London event in April. AK also dropped its harsh stance on three-time world cross country 4km champion Edith Masai. Masai missed Kenya's world cross country trials because of an ankle problem but AK insisted it would take disciplinary action unless she could prove she was really injured. \"Subject to our doctor's confirmation, we have decided to clear Masai,\" added Kiplagat. \n",
      "85.4% GB select Holmes for double bid  Kelly Holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's European Indoor Championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.  The double-Olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first European Indoors in Madrid. But UK Athletics chief Max Jones believes it is likely Holmes will race. He said: \"It's worth a punt, isn't it? She's gone back to training. If she's confident she will pick one (distance). The programme does not permit both.\" If Holmes does take her place in the GB side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. Under championship rules, she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in Madrid on 4 March. Jones added: \"She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend's Grand Prix). \"I am inclined to think she will (compete). It could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.\" And he admitted Holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the Norwich Union GB team. \"She is a very good team member and is very good to have there,\" he added. Meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the Great Britain team announced on Tuesday.  Defending 60m champion Jason Gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. He will be joined in the event by Mark Lewis-Francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in Vienna - and new boy Darren Chin. Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. Sotherton finished third in the Olympic heptathlon in Athens, where the Swede took gold. There are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in GB's 46-strong team. The championships will be the last to be attended by Jones before he retires to be succeeded by Dave Collins. Jones said: \"The Olympic Games is the overwhelming target for UKA and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games. \"The European Indoor Championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. \"Madrid is the first small step on a long journey to Beijing and the 2008 Olympics but for some of the emerging athletes, this will be a very important step.\"  60m: D Chin (Belgrave Harriers), J Gardener (Wessex and Bath), M Lewis-Francis (Birchfield Harriers).

      "89.3% Flintoff fit to bowl at Wanderers  Fourth Test, Wanderers: South Africa v England  Plays starts Thursday, 0830 GMT  There had been concerns his rib muscle injury would restrict him to playing as a specialist batsman in the match. Captain Michael Vaughan said: \"He's had a bowl and came out fine so he is fully fit to play as an all-rounder. \"We will see how he bowls. In Cape Town I thought he was our best bowler and in Durban probably our second best.\" Flintoff sent down around 20 deliveries at three-quarter pace during Wednesday's practice session. The 27-year-old incurred a side strain during the 196-run defeat in Cape Townlast week and did not bowl again until the eve of the Johannesburg Test. Vaughan said he would not necessarily shield Flintoff from bowling the same heavy workload he endured in the first three Tests. The skipper commented: \"We will just have to judge who is bowling well on any given day and on the given surface to see how much we use him.  \"But as a far as we're concerned he is available to play any role required.\" Opening batsman Marcus Trescothick said the team remained confident despite the defeat in Cape Town which left the series evenly poised at 1-1 with two to play. He said: \"We're allowed the odd blip here and there. You don't win eight in a row without being something special. \"The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off.\" With Flintoff happily fit to play and England thus likely to by unchanged, the form of pace spearhead Steve Harmison is the main concern. Trescothick said: \"Steve's been fine throughout. [The ball's] just not been coming out so well. \"Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly people come back from those. But he'll come back from that, we're just waiting for it to happen.

      "89.2% IAAF will contest Greek decision  The International Association of Athletics Federations will appeal against the acquittal of Greek athletes Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou.  The high-profile duo were cleared of doping offences by the Greek Athletics Federation (Segas) last month. Now the IAAF will lodge an appeal with the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) and has suspended both athletes. An IAAF statement said: \"The Doping Review Board concluded that the decision is erroneous.\" The statement continued: \"Both athletes' cases will be refered to arbitration before the CAS. The decision in both cases will be final and binding.\"  Segas said the IAAF appeal was \"expected\" and \"understandable.\" \"Now we are going to await the final result, which we cannot prejudge,\" said Segas chairman Vassilis Sevastis. Kenteris, who won Olympic 200m gold at the 2000 Olympics, and Thanou were suspended by the IAAF last December after failing to take routine drugs tests before the Athens Games. However, the independent tribunal overturned those bans, clearing the sprinters of avoiding tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics.  Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis described the IAAF's decision as \"not unexpected\" but told BBC Sport he did not expect the organisation to take action so quickly. \"The IAAF's timing is extremely surprising and it creates concerns and questions,\" said Ioannidis. \"The IAAF has not yet received the complete file of proceedings which include statements, testimonies, the closing speeches of defence counsel... and nine audio tapes.  \"We have the evidence and it is time the world discovered the truth.\" Kenteris and Thanou dramatically withdrew from last summer's Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August. The pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee who demanded the IAAF investigate the affair. Thanou and Kenteris still face a criminal trial later this year for allegedly avoiding the test and then faking a motorcycle accident \n",
      "88.8% England claim historic series win  Fifth Test, Centurion, day five: South Africa 247 & 296-6d drew with England 359 & 73-4  England win five-match series 2-1  Centuries from Jacques Kallis and AB de Villiers allowed South Africa to declare on 296-6, setting England a target of 185 to win from 44 overs. The tourists chose not to chase the runs, however, finishing on 73-4. There were plenty of nervous moments when they lost early wickets but captain Michael Vaughan held firm to secure a 2-1 series triumph. Though the usually brilliant Andrew Strauss scored a duck, only Denis Compton had ever scored more runs in a series against South Africa and he won the man-of-the-series award for his three centuries. Kallis and man-of-the-match de Villiers were in occupation of the crease when the day started, with South Africa still trailing by 53 runs. By the time they had been parted, they had added 227 for the third wicket. The scoring rate was never sensational, however, as Vaughan declined to set over-attacking fields and the batsman refused to take undue risks.  It took more than an hour for the lead to be wiped off, as De Villiers hit arguably the shot of the day - a pull off Matthew Hoggard that went all the way for six. The remaining hour-and-a-half of an extended morning session saw a further 100 runs added. The two right-handers were quick to pull and drive when the opportunities presented themselves. Kallis was twice lucky to survive. At one point he edged Hoggard inches short of Marcus Trescothick at slip and then, on 76, looked lucky to survive an lbw appeal against Simon Jones. De Villiers reached his half-century with a square drive off Ashley Giles for four, and he continued to play the spinner with great certainty. In the afternoon session, it was widely assumed South Africa would throw the bat at almost everything. First, however, both batsmen needed to reach their centuries.  Kallis got there first, cutting Jones for four - it was his fifth Test ton against England and 20th in all. The 20-year-old de Villiers became the third youngest South African to hit a Test century with a boundary in the same area off the same bowler. But he then perished when holing out to third man off Jones. He had made 109 off 169 balls. Oddly, Kallis took stock for a while before launching a few more boundaries shortly before the declaration, finally finishing unbeaten on 136. In the hunt for quick runs, Graeme Smith, Jacques Rudolph and Mark Boucher all perished for single figure scores. A grateful Steve Harmison took his first two wickets since Cape Town and Hoggard added a single victim to finish with 26 in the series. Set 185 from 44 overs, England were never in position to go for the target once Strauss had been caught behind in Ntini's first over.  Things looked dicey when Robert Key provided just 40 minutes of uncertain resistance before edging Pollock to Boucher. And there were certainly a few skipped heartbeats in the England dressing-room when Trescothick inexplicably missed a straight ball from Ntini to be bowled. That left 29 overs remaining for South Africa to try to find the last seven wickets. Vaughan and Graham Thorpe, however, proved adept at blunting some impressive spells from all the bowlers until Ntini returned to have Thorpe caught by Herschelle Gibbs who was close in at third slip. England had just about done enough by then and the game ended in bad light two-and-half overs early with Vaughan 26 not out and Andrew Flintoff unbeaten on 14. It was England's first series win in South Africa since MJK Smith led them to a 1-0 win in 1964-65. And it earned them the Basil D'Oliveira Trophy, named after the player who the South African apartheid regime refused to allow to tour their country with England in 1968, ultimately resulting in their exclusion from international sport.

      "88.7% Flintoff fit to bowl at Wanderers  Fourth Test, Wanderers: South Africa v England  Plays starts 0830 GMT  The fourth Test begins at the Wanderers on Thursday. Trescothick said: \"We're allowed the odd blip here and there. \"You don't win eight in a row without being something special as a team.\" England's main concern continues to be the fitness of Andrew Flintoff, who is recovering from a torn side muscle and may not be able to bowl in the Test. Trescothick said England had appreciated having two days off in Cape Town \"to chill out and relax\" in what is otherwise the most intense tour the players have ever experienced. But he voiced concern about Flintoff. \"Side strains can be quite difficult because it's such a big area [for fast bowlers] to generate pace when they're bowling,\" he said.  \"He's had six days off but he's not sure how it's going to react. We'll see how he goes in the nets and hopefully he'll come through unscathed. \"Any time you lose one of your bowlers it's difficult but when it's an all-rounder it creates a bit of a gap in the team so hopefully we are not going to get to that situation.\" The form of pace spearhead Steve Harmison is another concern. Trescothick said: \"Steve's been fine throughout. [The ball's] just not been coming out so well. \"Everyone goes through dips in form - it just depends how quickly pepole come back from those. But he'll come back from that, we're just waiting for it to happen. \"The guys are generally in good spirits, they needed the time off.\"  Graeme Smith (capt), Nicky Boje, Mark Boucher, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Boeta Dippenaar, Herschelle Gibbs, Andrew Hall, Jacques Kallis, Charl Langeveldt, Makhaya Ntini, Shaun Pollock, Jacques Rudolph, Dale Steyn.

      "88.5% Greek pair attend drugs hearing  Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have appeared before an independent tribunal which will decide if their bans should stand.  They were given provisional suspensions by athletics' ruling body the IAAF in December for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. The pair arrived with former coach Christos Tzekos to give evidence at the Hellenic Olympic Committee's offices. A decision is expected to be announced before the end of February. Whatever the ruling, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Yiannis Papadoyiannakis, who was head of the Greek Olympic team at the Athens Games last year, also testified at the tribunal, along with other Greek sports officials and athletes. \"I believe the tribunal will reach a decision that will uphold the standing of the institution,\" said Papadoyiannakis. \"Whatever the athletes have done, we must not forget that they have offered us great moments.\" Kenteris won 200m gold at the 2000 Sydney Olympics, while Thanou won silver in the 100m.  They withdrew from the Athens Games last August after missing drugs tests on the eve of the opening ceremony. The pair spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. The five-member tribunal, assembled by the Hellenic Association of Amateur Athletics, is also examining allegations that Kenteris and Thanou avoided tests in Tel Aviv and Chicago before the Games. Tzekos was also banned for two years by the IAAF. He faces charges of assisting in the use of prohibited substances and tampering with the doping inspection process. All three, who have repeatedly denied the allegations, have also been charged by a Greek prosecutor and face trial for doping-related charges. A trial date has not been set. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". But Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport earlier this week he was confident the sprinters would be cleared of the charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to testing. \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical,\" he said. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\" \n",
      "88.4% Rain holds up England  Fifth Test, Centurion. South Africa v England  Start delayed, rain  England lead the series 2-1 with just this final Test remaining so South Africa desperately need to win. The officials had hoped play could get under way at noon local time but a further downpour led to an early lunch being taken by the players. For England, Simon Jones is expected to replace James Anderson while the hosts play both Andrew Hall and Andre Nel, with batsman Boeta Dippenaar dropped. Dale Steyn had already been released from the squad for Centurion and it means South Africa go in with five seamers and one spin bowler.  On Friday, England captain Michael Vaughan had said it was important his team targeted victory and not simply a draw. He said: \"You can't set out over five days to draw a game. We have to try to win. If you go out in a mindset to draw you don't have the right attitude. \"We'll just set out in a positive manner and try to put the South Africans under a lot of pressure.\" England, who have not won a series in South Africa for 40 years, will play on a green pitch which has endured a long spell of wet and humid weather. The weather forecast for Saturday onwards is fine, and early starts on all four days from then could ensure there is plenty of time to achieve a result.  Middlesex opener Andrew Strauss, with a stunning aggregate of 612 runs in the four Tests played to date, said South Africa had every incentive to throw caution to the wind. He said: \"It's been a great series for me. It's been very satisfying. \"But I think we all realise that this last game is very important and we can't afford to take our foot off the pedal now. \"Sometimes when you've got a lead it's quite hard to keep yourself motivated.  \"We are pretty sure that the South Africans will come back hard at us. They have a lot of motivation to do well against us this week.\" South Africa captain Graeme Smith said the colour of the pitch was probably misleading. He said: \"The pitch has played pretty well all year. It might look a bit juicy but will probably play pretty good.\" He added that his team had the capability of bouncing back. \"We came back in New Zealand from 1-0 down to level the series in Wellington so we've been in this situation before. \"We've just got to play some really good cricket for four to five days. We've had had a lot of iffy performances so far. \"With a bit of luck here or there or playing some better cricket at certain times it could have easily been the other way round. \"It's been that sort of series, ebb and flow, and I'm sure it's going to be that way again.\"  Graeme Smith (capt.), Herschelle Gibbs, Jacques Rudolph, Jacques Kallis, AB de Villiers, Mark Boucher (wkt), Andrew Hall, Nicky Boje, Shaun Pollock, Makhaya Ntini, Andre Nel.

      "88.4% England eye win after Thorpe ton  Second Test, Durban, day four (close): England: 139 & 570-7d v South Africa 332 & 21-1  Thorpe shared in stands of 114 with Andrew Flintoff (60) and 132 with Geraint Jones (73) after England had lost three for 21 in the morning. The left-hander's 16th Test ton came off 209 balls and included 15 fours. The hosts fell to 21-1 at stumps, with Matthew Hoggard trapping home skipper Graeme Smith lbw for five. To win, South Africa will have to break their own chasing record at the ground, which they set in 2002 when scoring 340 to beat Australia. On day three South Africa waited all day for a wicket, but three came along at once when play resumed on the fourth. Makhaya Ntini was the man to ignite the flame, tempting Andrew Strauss into a dalliance outside the off-stump which was pouched by Martin van Jaarsveld at third slip.  The prolific opener had added only four runs to his overnight 132 when departing. Ntini followed up with the wicket of Michael Vaughan, whose poor run continued when he was cramped up by a short ball and gloved behind for 10, taking his four-innings aggregate this series to 53. Shaun Pollock was doing a fine job tying up his end, and England soon fell to 314-4 when Jacques Kallis put an end to Mark Butcher's painful 70-ball 13. It left the visitors' leading by just 121 with the middle-order exposed, but the lack of depth in South Africa's attack gave England the chance to stabilise. With Graeme Smith forced to rely on support acts Dale Steyn (1-122) and Nicky Boje (1-163), England reasserted thanks to Thorpe and his partnerships with Flintoff and Jones. Flintoff, careful to avoid a pair of ducks, was indecisive early on, edging streakily for four and being struck on the shoulder in one Steyn over. But the all-rounder ended the first session with a full-blooded cover-drive that sent Steyn to the fence, and he carried on in similar vein after the interval. A six off Pollock over long-on was followed by two more off Ntini over square-leg, and Flintoff emulated Thorpe by reaching 50 with a boundary. South Africa's only strike of the afternoon came when Smith offered a long-hop to Flintoff and enticed an edge, which AB de Villiers gloved behind the stumps. England's scoring rate increased when Jones came to the crease, and he complemented Thorpe's grafting approach with some abrasive strokeplay. The keeper blazed 73 off 82 balls, with 10 fours and two sixes, as England chased quick runs prior to the declaration, joining Thorpe in top-edging the hapless Steyn over the keeper's head on numerous occasions. South Africa were forced to place a fielder at long-stop, but the runs continued to flow until Jones holed out at long-on to give Boje his sole strike. Ashley Giles, who will be fit to bowl in day five after suffering back spasms, came out to bat, but his swift removal by Steyn prompted the declaration.

      "88.4% Greek pair set for hearing  Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou will fight the provisional two-year bans imposed on them by the IAAF at an independent tribunal this weekend.  Athletics' ruling body took action against the pair for failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics. An independent tribunal of the Greek Track and Field Federation will meet to decide whether to ratify the sanction. The sprint duo face charges of failing to give information on their location and refusing to submit to a drugs test. Kenteris' lawyer Gregory Ioannidis told BBC Sport: \"We refute both charges as unsubstantiated and illogical. \"There have been certain breaches in the correct application of the rules on behalf of the sporting authorities and their officials, and these procedural breaches have also violated my client's rights. \"There is also evidence that proves the fact that my client has been persecuted.\" Ioannidis, who is a law lecturer at the University of Buckingham, added: \"One of the important rights and foundations of law and justice - that the accused should be presumed innocent unless proved otherwise - has been tarnished.\" The panel will also decide on the two-year ban imposed on the athletes' controversial coach Christos Tzekos by the IAAF. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, quit the Olympics on 18 August after failing to give samples on the eve of the opening ceremony.  Testers could not find them at the Olympic village and the duo were later admitted to hospital after claiming to have been involved in a motorcycle accident. They also missed tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens before the Games. In imposing two-year suspensions on the duo on 22 December, the IAAF described their explanations for missing the tests as \"unacceptable\". Whatever the findings of the independent tribunal, all parties will have the right to appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The tribunal hearing will take place at the Hellenic Olympic Committee building. It will start at 1200 GMT on Saturday and is expected to finish early next week. The tribunal panel will consist of five members - president Konstantinos Panagopoulos and Panagiotis Dimakos, Haralabos Hrisanthakis, Stilianos Perakis and Ioannis Karmis. Kenteris and Thanou also face criminal charges in Greece for allegedly faking the motorcycle accident. Eight criminal charges have been laid against the sprinters as well as Tzekos, an eyewitness to the accident and hospital officials. But there has been speculation that the charges could be dropped. \n",
      "88.1% Greek sprinters suspended by IAAF  Greek sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been suspended after failing to take drugs tests before the Athens Olympics.  Athletics' ruling body the IAAF said explanations from the pair and their former coach as to why they missed the tests were \"unacceptable\". It added that Kenteris and Thanou had been \"provisionally suspended pending the resolution of their cases\". They face two-year bans if found guilty by the Greek Athletics Federation. The suspension also covers the athletes' controversial coach, Christos Tzekos. Kenteris, the 2000 Olympic 200m champion, and Thanou, the women's 100m silver medallist from the same Games in Sydney, also face a criminal hearing in Greece over the missed tests. They failed to appear to give samples in Chicago and Tel Aviv shortly before the Athens Games and again in Athens on 12 August, the eve of the opening ceremony. Greek prosecutors have also charged them with faking a midnight motorcycle crash which led to them spending four days in hospital. Some medical staff have been charged with writing false medical reports. Wednesday's statement said the Greek Federation (SEGAS) would convene a disciplinary hearing for the trio to determine whether there had been doping violations.  \"There will be a final right of appeal from the decision of the Greek Federation to the Court of Arbitration for Sport,\" the IAAF said. Tzekos insisted he and the runners had nothing to hide. \"The IAAF's decision means nothing,\" he said. \"We'll be presenting all our arguments to SEGAS - we're innocent.\" \n",
      "87.9% Greek duo cleared in doping case  Sprinters Kostas Kenteris and Katerina Thanou have been cleared of doping offences by an independent tribunal.  The duo had been provisionally suspended by the IAAF for allegedly missing three drugs tests, including one on the eve of the Athens Olympics. But the Greek Athletics Federation tribunal has overturned the bans - a decision which the IAAF can now contest at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. The pair's former coach, Christos Tzekos, has been banned for four years. Kenteris, 31, and Thanou, 30, had been charged with avoiding drug tests in Tel Aviv, Chicago and Athens and failing to notify anti-doping officials of their whereabouts before the Olympics. They withdrew from the Olympics after missing a drugs test at the Olympic Village on 12 August.  The pair then spent four days in a hospital, claiming they had been injured in a motorcycle crash. It was the International Olympic Committee's demand that the IAAF investigate the affair that led to the hearing of the Greek tribunal. The head of that tribunal, Kostas Panagopoulos, said it had not been proven that the athletes refused to take the test in Athens. \"The charge cannot be substantiated,\" he said. \"In no way was he (Kenteris) informed to appear for a doping test. The same goes for Thanou.\" Kenteris's lawyer, Gregory Ioannidis, said: \"The decision means Mr Kenteris has been exonerated of highly damaging and unfounded charges which have been extremely harmful for his career.  \"He has consistently maintained his innocence and this was substantiated by further evidence we were able to submit to the tribunal following its deliberations in January. \"This evidence shows Mr Kenteris was never asked to submit to a test by the International Olympic Committee so he could not possibly have been guilty of deliberately avoiding one. It shows he has no case to answer. \"Mr Kenteris should now be given the opportunity he deserves to rebuild his career in the full knowledge that there is no stain on his character. \"He has suffered greatly throughout this ordeal that has exposed both himself and his family to enormous pressures.\" But the IAAF said it was \"very surprised\" by the verdict. Spokesman Nick Davies said: \"We note the decision of the Greek authorities with interest. \"Our doping review board will now consider the English version of the decision.\" \n",

      "87.1% Australia return to winning ways  Second one-day international, Sydney: Australia 261-7 (50 overs) beat New Zealand 244 (47.1 overs) by 17 runs  Adam Gilchrist (60) and Darren Lehmann (52) played the leading roles as the home side totalled 261-7. New Zealand crumbled to 86-6 in reply but Chris Cairns hit 50 off 40 balls and Kyle Mills and Daniel Vettori put on 70 to keep their side in the hunt. But they were eventually all out for 244 and the three-match series will now be decided in Brisbane on Friday. The game came to an end at the start of the 48th over when Chris Harris, who bravely came out to bat in his 250th one-day game despite a shoulder injury, was bowled by a yorker from Glenn McGrath. Mills was left high and dry on 44 not out after a magnificent 26-ball innings, featuring four big sixes. There were plenty of anxious faces among the Australian fans during his ninth wicket stand with Vettori (33), who was finally run out by Ricky Ponting's underarm throw. Home skipper Ponting had earlier chosen to bat after winning the toss and was rewarded as Adam Gilchrist took the attack to the New Zealand seamers. He struck a six and eight fours to reach his half century off only 37 deliveries, before perishing for 60 in cavalier fashion as a pull shot off Scott Styris was caught by Nathan Astle at deep square leg.  Ponting maintained the tempo with a quickfire 32 but his exit, caught at mid-off from the bowling of Mills, sparked a slump which saw Australia decline from 140-2 to 161-6. Matthew Hayden (43) was run out by Mathew Sinclair, Damien Martyn was lbw to Mills for five and Andrew Symonds faced only two balls before he was trapped in front by Vettori. Michael Clarke was next to go for six when he edged a ball from Chris Cairns to keeper Brendon McCullum. But Darren Lehmann and Brad Hogg prevented the innings from going into freefall, adding 74 in 17 overs for the seventh wicket. Lehmann was run out, leaving Hogg (41 not out) and Brett Lee (10 not out) to see the total past 250 to leave the Kiwis facing a tough target.  They made a poor start as Astle was caught behind off Brett Lee for 11 and Sinclair fell victim to Jason Gillespie for 17, with Matthew Hayden taking the catch. Captain Stephen Fleming fell lbw for 34 to left-arm spinner Hogg, who proved the most successful Australian bowler with figures of 3-45. The middle order followed in quick succession and it looked like the home side would wrap things up in double quick time. Cairns counter attacked with two sixes and four fours before Gillespie brought his innings to an end, leaving Mills and Vettori to try and secure an unlikely victory. The required rate came down to a run per ball thanks to Mills' big-hitting exploits, but Harris was greeted by a short-pitched ball aimed at his chest and a ferocious full toss from Lee after Vettori had been dismissed. The veteran, whose suffered a torn rotator cuff while fielding earlier in the game, collected four singles but his gallantry was in vain as McGrath produced the perfect delivery to bring the game to an end.  M Hayden, A Gilchrist (wkt), R Ponting (capt), D Lehmann, D Martyn, A Symonds, M Clarke, B Hogg, J Gillespie, B Lee, G McGrath.

      "86.9% O'Gara revels in Ireland victory  Ireland fly-half Ronan O'Gara hailed his side's 19-13 victory over England as a \"special\" win.  The Munster number 10 kicked a total of 14 points, including two drop goals, to help keep alive their Grand Slam hopes. He told BBC Sport: \"We made hard work of it but it's still special to beat England. \"I had three chances to win the game but didn't. We have work to do after this but we never take a victory over England lightly.\" Ireland hooker Shane Byrne echoed O'Gara's comments but admitted the game had been England's best outing in the Six Nations. Byrne said: \"It was a really, really hard game but from one to 15 in our team we worked really, really hard. \"We just had to stick to our defensive pattern, trust ourselves and trust those around us. All round it was fantastic.\" Ireland captain Brian O'Driscoll, who scored his side's only try, said: \"We are delighted, we felt if we performed well then we would win but with England also having played very well it makes it all the sweeter. \"We did get the bounce of the ball and some days that happens and you've just got to jump on the back of it.\"  Ireland coach Eddie O'Sullivan was surprised that England coach Andy Robinson said he was certain Mark Cueto was onside for a disallowed try just before the break. \"Andy was sitting two yards from me and I couldn't see whether he was offside or not so I don't know how Andy could have known,\" said O'Sullivan.  \"What I do know is that England played well and when that happens it makes a very good victory for us. \"We had to defend for long periods and that is all good for the confidence of the team. \"I think our try was very well worked, it was a gem, as good a try as we have scored for a while.\" O'Sullivan also rejected Robinson's contention England dominated the forward play. \"I think we lost one lineout and they lost four or five so I don't know how that adds up to domination,\" he said. O'Driscoll also insisted Ireland were happy to handle the pressure of being considered favourites to win the Six Nations title. \"This season for the first time we have been able to play with the favourites' tag,\" he said. \"Hopefully we have proved that today and can continue to keep doing so. \"As for my try it was a move we had worked on all week. There was a bit of magic from Geordan Murphy and it was a great break from Denis Hickie.\" \n",
      "86.8% Campese berates whingeing England  Former Australian wing David Campese has told England to stop whingeing in the wake of their defeat to Ireland.  England coach Andy Robinson lambasted referee Jonathan Kaplan for costing them the game after disallowing tries from Mark Cueto and Josh Lewsey. But Campese told BBC Sport: \"Robinson is living up to England's reputation as whingeing Poms. \"Stop going on about it as who really cares? They're acting like they're the first team to be cheated of a win.\"  England are contemplating a complaint to the International Rugby Board after potential \"tries\" by Cueto in the first half and Lewsey late on were ruled out without recourse to the video referee. But Campese added: \"Scotland could have beaten France in the same way, but do you see them whingeing? \"Basically, things didn't go England's way and, in typical fashion, they make more of it when they believe they've lost unfairly.\"  England are second bottom in the Six Nations table following defeats by Wales, France and Ireland. But although Campese admitted he was surprised about their current predicament, he insisted England were \"no longer world class\". \"England are beginning to realise that being world champions doesn't mean you deserve to win every game,\" he said. \"They lost a few key players and suddenly everyone's realised the ones on the fringes were not all that good in the first place. \"Added to that, the senior players aren't standing up and they can't do anything when the pressure mounts.\"  Campese, a veteran of 101 international caps, said full-back Jason Robinson would now be the sole Englishman in his World XV. Robinson has been blamed for poor leadership in the tournament, while his coach has been castigated for appointing a full-back captain. \"I agree that you can't captain from full-back,\" said Campese. \"You need someone in the thick of the action, and it's very hard to give orders from all the way back there. \"Some people are leaders and some aren't. He's not but there's no one who stands out in England's pack - no clear-cut leaders.\" Campese, though, defended coach Andy Robinson, who he believes was the \"only choice\" after Sir Clive Woodward's resignation.  But he blamed \"a lack of talent in the England camp\" for making the current coach look poor. England face a potential wooden spoon match against Italy on 12 March. And the ex-Wallaby added: \"If England lost that, they'd be in bloody turmoil. That said, I don't think they will.\" Campese has tipped Wales to win both the Six Nations and Grand Slam come the end of the tournament. \"It's been a surprising tournament,\" he said, \"and maybe Ireland have a little bit more talent overall. \"But playing at home is a major boost. And the possible Grand Slam decider at the Millennium Stadium will be just too much for the Irish.\" \n",
      "86.5% Sella wants Michalak recall  Former France centre Philippe Sella believes coach Bernard Laporte must recall Frederic Michalak to give his side any chance of beating Ireland.  Sella admitted he had been impressed by current fly-half Yann Delaigue in the RBS Six Nations to date. But he told BBC Sport: \"Michalak is the answer both now and for the future. Delaigue deserved his chance but the time has come to bring back Michalak. \"He does have weaknesses but has the all-round game to upset Ireland.\" The 22-year-old Michalak has spent much of the tournament on the bench after Delaigue impressed for Castres early in the season. With Michalak overlooked, the French stuttered to narrow wins over Scotland and then England before ironically playing their best rugby in the defeat to Wales. \"The Wales game was amazing to watch but never did I think the French could lose that game at half-time,\" said Sella.  \"Their only mistakes were that they didn't score enough points in the first half and were a little bit less focused in the second... but only a little bit.\" Sella, however, insisted the pressure had eased on the under-fire Laporte, despite the defeat at the Stade de France. \"This season is very important for shaping a team for the 2007 World Cup,\" said Sella, \"which Laporte is doing very well. The French get better every game. \"It's difficult, though, when you change a team and you change your tactics as everything has to gel. \"But he has the players and the talent to take them all the way to World Cup victory. \"As a result, it is important that people give him time. It may not seem good now that we're not winning the Grand Slam but no one will care in two years time if we're world champions.\"  The majority of media criticism centred on the way in which France produced a performance devoid of running rugby in their opening two games. But while Sella admitted he liked the more flowing style employed against Wales, he said \"the win was most important\". \"Winning is all that matters,\" he added. \"Ok, the flair may not have been so good, but the discipline, organisation and defence was there, which are all important ahead of 2007.\" France play what Sella believes is their hardest game of the Six Nations against Ireland in Dublin on Saturday 12 March. The French go into the game as clear underdogs. But Sella added: \"People forget that France can still win the Six Nations and they'll be focused on that. \"But Ireland will be going for even more in front of their home crowd. It's going to be tough.\" \n",

He has been in good form with both bat and ball in domestic cricket, making his highest first-class score of 115 and taking eight wickets in the game as Auckland beat Northern Districts in the State Championship. New Zealand breathed a sigh of relief when Brendon McCullum and Scott Styris were cleared of code of conduct charges on Thursday.  But they will not finalise their line-up until shortly before the game because of persistent bad weather in Brisbane which forced Gabba groundsman Kev Mitchell to change the pitch to be used for the game. More rain is forecast for Friday, which could mean Duckworth-Lewis calculations having a big say in the outcome. \"We are keeping our options open and won't be rushing to name our side until we are confident with the knowledge we have on the wicket we are going to play on,\" coach John Bracewell commented. They did well to run Australia close in Sydney after being reduced to 86-6, with Chris Cairns, Kyle Milss and Daniel Vettori showing the depth of their batting talent. \"I thought we showed considerable guts and determination,\" Bracewell added. Simon Katich is the likely replacement for Hayden in the Australian team, but they face a dilemma over who should open with Adam Gilchrist. Katich went in first in a one-day game against India at the start of the year but prefers the middle order and they could opt to promote Darren Lehmann instead. Lehmann has only opened four times in 110 limited overs internationals, but his last three scores in that role have been 92 not out, 50 not out and 119. The state of the pitch will also be a major factor in deciding the make-up of their attack. Michael Kasprowicz could return in place of spinner Brad Hogg as part of a four-pronged pace attack. But that would be tough on Hogg, who made 41 not out and took three wickets in the last match, and would also leave the hosts with a long tail.  R Ponting (capt), A Gilchrist (wkt), D Martyn, D Lehmann, S Katich, M Clarke, A Symonds, B Hogg, B Lee, S Watson, J Gillespie, G McGrath, M Kasprowicz.

      "85.9% Wilson back in Kiwi cricket squad  Former All Blacks winger Jeff Wilson is back in the New Zealand cricket squad after a 12-year absence.  Wilson has been included by the Kiwis to face a World XI in a one-day series in aid of the tsunami victims. His last outing for the national team was in 1993 when he gave up cricket to concentrate on his rugby union career, which came to an end in 2002. \"Now that I have this chance I am looking forward to getting in there and making the most of it,\" said Wilson. Wilson had set his sights on returning to the New Zealand side after resuming domestic first class cricket and team coach John Bracewell has said the one-day matches are a chance for the ex-All Blacks winger to re-establish himself.  \"His match turning ability is undoubted and we just need to see if he can step up to this level again,\" said NZ coach Bracewell. \"The selectors have watched Jeff and have no doubt that he is a dynamic cricketer.\" In March 1993, Wilson played four one day international matches against Australia. He scored a match-winning 44 not out in the final game of the series before concentrating on rugby union after making his debut for the All Blacks later that year. Wilson takes the place of fast bowler Ian Butler, who is suffering from a bulging disc in his back. The limited-overs series against a World XI side being led by Australian leg spinner Shane Warne begins in Christchurch on 22 January with the two other matches taking place in Wellington on 24 January and Hamilton on 26 January. More than 9,000 tickets were sold on the first day of them being made available. \"Given the very limited lead-time for these matches, we obviously need the public to respond quickly and today has given us a good start,\" said New Zealand Cricket marketing manager Peter Dwan.

      "85.9% Castaignede fires Laporte warning  Former France fly-half Thomas Castaignede has warned the pressure is mounting on coach Bernard Laporte following their defeat by Wales.  France suffered a shock loss against the Welsh at the weekend after looking on course for an easy win. Castaignede told BBC Sport: \"The pressure is big on Laporte after a huge loss to New Zealand, a slim win over Scotland and a miracle against England. \"But the French have to get behind him and the team at Lansdowne Road.\" Following victories over South Africa and Australia in November, France were deemed by many to be the world's leading side. But they were then trounced 45-6 by New Zealand and only just beat Scotland after the Scots had a try disallowed in their Six Nations opener. It then took some woeful spot kicking from Charlie Hodgson and Olly Barkley to help them to victory against England at Twickenham. &lt;  Castaignede said: \"You can't say any of those results have eased the pressure on Laporte. \"Had England's kickers not been so bad, the position in the Six Nations would be very different now.\" Laporte has been criticised for France's negative tactics in their wins over Scotland and England. But his side played a more free-flowing style against Wales, making a mockery of the opposition's defence in the first half before suffering a shock turnaround in fortunes after the interval. \"All the chat in France has been about how France will play against Ireland,\" said Castaignede ahead of the 12 March tie. \"Everyone wants to see the sort of play we saw against Wales. But everyone also wants a win.\" Castaignede, a veteran of 43 international caps, admitted the French would go in as underdogs against Ireland.  \"Going to Ireland is never easy but the way they're playing right now, it's harder than ever,\" said Castaignede. \"They're very experienced and don't often lose at home. They've got some great forwards and some electric runners on the break.\" Despite praising the Irish he claimed the Welsh had the upper hand in the Six Nations run-in. \"Ireland have such a good pack but Wales are something else on the break,\" he added. \"At the weekend they were simply awesome. As a Frenchman it was disappointing to see, but you had to admire it. \"Their commitment to every cause can make them win this championship.\" The 30-year-old also tipped Yann Delaigue to start ahead of Frederic Michalak at number 10 after an impressive display in Paris last weekend. \"Delaigue played really well and admittedly Michalak played well too,\" said Castaignede. \"I'm just glad I'm not the one who has to make the decision.\" \n",
      "85.6% Italy aim to rattle England  Italy coach John Kirwan believes his side can upset England as the Six Nations wooden spoon battle hots up.  The two sides, both without a win, meet on 12 March at Twickenham and Kirwan says his side will be hoping to make the most of England's current slump. \"We have to make sure the England and France games are tough for them. \"England have not been having the best of championships. That is a big one for us and them and I am sure my players will rise to the occasion,\" he said. But Kirwan admits that a lot of hard work will be needed with his kickers before the trip to London. Roland de Marigny and Luciano Orquera had a miserable time with the boot in the dire defeat to Scotland as Chris Paterson stole the show to give the hosts a much-needed 18-10 victory. Kirwan said: \"The kicking was the decisive factor in Scotland which cost us and it could go down to the kicking again next time. \"But I have a lot of confidence in my players and I am positive we can put everything together against England.\" England, meanwhile, are licking their wounds and rueing what might have been had two decisions from referee Jonathan Kaplan not gone against them in the second half in Dublin. First Mark Cueto was judged offside as he chased fly-half Charlie Hodgson's kick, and then Kaplan opted not to call upon video evidence to see if Josh Lewsey had touched down after being driven over Ireland's line.  But centre Jamie Noon believes the side at least showed better form than their previous two defeats. \"We definitely improved against an in-form Irish side,\" he said. \"We went to Dublin quietly confident that we would be able to compete, and I think we showed that. \"We have got to make sure we now take the form and positives into the Italy game. We are under no illusions that it is going to be easy, but we definitely need a win.\" England have now equalled an 18-year low of four successive championship defeats, including France in Paris last season, and have lost four in a row under Andy Robinson. His predecessor, Sir Clive Woodward, began his seven-year reign with three defeats and two draws. \n",

      "88.1% Italy 17-28 Ireland  Two moments of magic from Brian O'Driscoll guided Ireland to a workmanlike victory against Italy.  A pair of classic outside breaks from the Ireland captain set up tries for Geordan Murphy and Peter Stringer. Italy led 9-8 early in the second half but Stringer's try gave Ireland a lead they never lost. The hosts cut the gap to 18-12 with 10 minutes left and nearly scored through Ludovico Nitoglia, but Denis Hickie's try ensured an Irish victory. Italy came flying out of the blocks and took the lead through a Luciano Orquera penalty after seven minutes.  It could have been better for the hosts but the fly-half missed two kickable penalties and Ireland drew level with a Ronan O'Gara penalty midway through the first half. The Italians were driving at the heart of the Irish defence and, for the first quarter, the Irish pack struggled to secure any ball for their talented backs.  When they finally did, just before the half-hour mark, O'Driscoll promptly created a sparkling try for Murphy. The Ireland captain ran a dummy scissors and made a magical outside break before drawing the full-back and putting the diving Murphy in at the corner. O'Gara missed the twice-taken conversion and the visitors found themselves trailing once again. Roland de Marigny took over the kicking duties for Italy from the hapless Orquera, and he landed a penalty either side of the break to edge Italy into a 9-8 lead.  The only Ireland player offering a real threat was O'Driscoll, and it was his break that set up the second try for the visitors. Shane Horgan threw an overhead pass as he was about to be forced into touch and Stringer scooted over, with O'Gara landing the tricky conversion. A penalty apiece saw Ireland leading 18-12 as the game entered the final quarter, but they were lucky to survive when Italy launched a series of attacks. Winger Nitoglia dropped the ball as he reached for the line and Italy nearly rumbled over from a driving maul.  An O'Gara penalty put Ireland more than a converted try ahead and they made the game safe when Hickie latched onto an inside pass from Murphy and crossed for a converted try. O'Driscoll limped off late on, joining centre partner Gordon D'Arcy on the sidelines, and the final word went to Italy.

      "87.1% Ireland surge past Scots  Ireland maintained their Six Nations Grand Slam ambitions with an impressive victory over Scotland at Murrayfield.  Hugo Southwell's try gave the Scots an early 8-0 lead but scores from locks Malcolm O'Kelly and Paul O'Connell put the visitors in command by half-time. A third try from wing Denis Hickie and third penalty from Ronan O'Gara, who kicked 13 points, extended the lead. Jon Petrie scored a second try for Scotland but late scores from John Hayes and Gavin Duffy sealed victory. After two hard-earned away victories, Eddie O'Sullivan' side can now look forward to welcoming England to Lansdowne Road in a fortnight. Scotland will try to give their coach Matt Williams a first Six Nations victory when Italy come to Edinburgh, but they again struggled to turn pressure into points. The home side started with tremendous intensity and dominated territory and possession in the opening 10 minutes. A powerful charge from flanker Jason White was carried on by Ali Hogg and when Ireland conceded a penalty close to their own line, Scotland kicked it to touch. The Irish defence foiled the home side on that occasion, but a stray hand in a ruck allowed Paterson to stroke over a penalty in the eighth minute.  If that was a paltry reward for their early pressure, Scotland got the try they deserved when Paterson's searing break and Andy Craig's pass sent Southwell streaking to the right corner. Paterson was off target with the conversion and fly-half Dan Parks then missed a presentable drop-goal attempt. Ireland got themselves on the scoreboard with an O'Gara penalty and by the 24th minute the visitors were ahead. Stuart Grimes pulled down O'Kelly at a line-out, Ireland kicked the penalty to touch and from the set-piece, the big lock was driven over by the rest of his pack.  O'Gara added the conversion and a further penalty, after Shane Horgan almost grabbed a second try from O'Gara's chip to the corner, only for the ball to spill from his hand. But Ireland still delivered a hammer blow to Scotland's hopes just before the interval. O'Connell - skipper in the absence of Brian O'Driscoll - powered through Parks' weak tackle after a free-kick from a scrummage to burrow over.  Scotland suffered a further blow on the resumption when Ireland flanker Johnny O'Connor won another vital turnover, and O'Gara's basketball pass sent Hickie over in the left corner. O'Gara converted and then thumped over a 40m penalty to give the visitors a commanding 28-8 advantage. Scotland looked bereft of ideas but a half-break from Paterson sparked them back to life just before the hour. Stuart Grimes won a line-out and a well-worked move saw Petrie scuttle round the side of the ruck to dive over in the left corner. But it proved a false dawn, and Ireland reasserted their authority in the final 10 minutes. Peter Stringer and O'Kelly combined to put giant prop Hayes over in the right corner before replacement Gavin Duffy scorched away on the left, David Humphreys adding the final flourish with a touchline conversion.  : C Paterson; S Danielli, A Craig, H Southwell, S Lamont; D Parks, C Cusiter; T Smith, G Bulloch (capt), G Kerr; S Grimes, S Murray; J White, A Hogg, J Petrie.

      "86.7% GB select Holmes for double bid  Kelly Holmes has been chosen for both the 800m and 1500m at next month's European Indoor Championships - despite not yet confirming her availability.  The double-Olympic champion is still undecided about whether to compete in her first European Indoors in Madrid. But UK Athletics chief Max Jones believes it is likely Holmes will race. He said: \"It's worth a punt, isn't it? She's gone back to training. If she's confident she will pick one (distance). The programme does not permit both.\" If Holmes does take her place in the GB side, she has already indicated that 1500m will be her favoured distance. Under championship rules, she does not have to decide until 24 hours before the event begins in Madrid on 4 March. Jones added: \"She was pleased with her run in Birmingham (at last weekend's Grand Prix). \"I am inclined to think she will (compete). It could depend on how training goes and she will have to be close to top form.\" And he admitted Holmes' presence would be a great boost to the rest of the Norwich Union GB team. \"She is a very good team member and is very good to have there,\" he added. Meanwhile, there is no surprises in the rest of the Great Britain team announced on Tuesday.  Defending 60m champion Jason Gardener is included and will be chasing his third successive gold medal. He will be joined in the event by Mark Lewis-Francis - runner-up behind him three years ago in Vienna - and new boy Darren Chin. Kelly Sotherton has been invited by championship organisers to compete against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon. Sotherton finished third in the Olympic heptathlon in Athens, where the Swede took gold. There are 16 newcomers at this level of competition in GB's 46-strong team. The championships will be the last to be attended by Jones before he retires to be succeeded by Dave Collins. Jones said: \"The Olympic Games is the overwhelming target for UKA and therefore it is beneficial to start the next four-year cycle with a not-so-pressurised major games. \"The European Indoor Championships always provide a chance for the young and inexperienced to make a name for themselves and the current indoor season has produced some exciting new talent. \"Madrid is the first small step on a long journey to Beijing and the 2008 Olympics but for some of the emerging athletes, this will be a very important step.\"  60m: D Chin (Belgrave Harriers), J Gardener (Wessex and Bath), M Lewis-Francis (Birchfield Harriers).

The world 60m champion got off to a rolling start and had to dig deep to dip ahead of Mark Findlay and Darren Chin, who both set personal bests. \"It was a close race,\" admitted Gardener. \"I stumbled out the blocks but my experience told through. \"I still feel there's more life in me and I believe I can go faster.\" Gardener's performance in Sheffield could have been affected by the news, which he heard before his semi-final, that his European record had been broken Frenchman Ronald Pognon, who will be a real threat at the European Championships, set a new time of 6.45, one-hundreth of a second faster than Gardener's previous mark.

The Trafford athlete, who has served a two-year ban after testing positive for anabolic steroids, clinched the title with a championship record 4.25m.  also set a new championship mark in the men's triple jump title in Sheffield. The 26-year-old, who has been training in Australia over the winter, landed 17.30m with his final effort - the longest leap in the world this year. \"I didn't have a clue,\" said Idowu. \"I've not jumped indoors before and I just wanted the qualifying mark. \"But this isn't a bad start and hopefully I'll come back from Madrid with a gold medal.\" Nathan Douglas continued his steady progress this season as he set a life-time best of 16.76m in second while Jonathan Moore took third.  and  resumed their rivalry in the long jump competition, both achieving the European standard. Commonwealth champion Morgan reached a personal best of 7.96m on his very first jump and then promptly retired with a bruised heel.

Gardener cruised home ahead of Scot Nick Smith to win the invitational race at the Norwich Union International. He then recovered from a poor start in the second race to beat Swede Daniel Persson and Italy's Luca Verdecchia. His times of 6.61 and 6.62 seconds were well short of American Maurice Greene's 60m world record of 6.39secs from 1998. \"It's a very hard record to break, but I believe I've trained very well,\" said the world indoor champion, who hopes to get closer to the mark this season. \"It was important to come out and make sure I got maximum points.

He stepped down from his favoured 400m to 200m to finish third in 21.72 secs. Germany's Alexander Kosenkow won the race in 21.07 secs with Dutchman Patrick van Balkom second in 21.58 secs. There were plenty of other senior British athletes showing their indoor form over the weekend. Promising 60m hurdler  clocked a new UK record of 7.98 seconds at a meeting in Norway. The 24-year-old reached the mark in her heat but had to settle for joint first place with former AAA champion Diane Allahgreen in the final.  , who broke onto the international scene at the Olympic Games last season, set an indoor personal best of 16.50m in the triple jump at a meeting in Ghent. That leap - 37cm short of Brazilian winner Jadel Gregorio's effort - was good enough to qualify for the European Indoor Championships. At the same meeting,  finished third in 7.27 seconds in a high-class women's 60m. The event was won by European medal favourite Christine Arron of France while Belgium rival Kim Gevaert was second. Britain's Joice Maduaka finished fifth in 7.35. Olympic bronze heptathlon medallist  made a low-key return to action at an indoor meeting in Birmingham. The 28-year-old cleared 1.76m to win the high jump and threw 13.86m in the women's shot put. \n",
      "85.5% Johnson edges out rival Sotherton  Jade Johnson edged out rival Kelly Sotherton with her last effort to claim the AAAs long jump title at the Norwich Union European Indoor trials.  Olympic heptathlon bronze medallist, Sotherton, led the event with her first leap of 6.43m - a personal best. But Johnson, who has not competed indoors for five years, leapt to a life-time best of 6.50m in her last jump, after four fouls. Both Johnson and Sotherton passed the European Championships qualifying mark. Although Sotherton's main aim in Madrid next month will be the pentathlon where she will take on Olympic heptathlon champion Carolina Kluft. Ireland's  delivered a shock in the men's 200m as he stormed to his first major title in 21.01 seconds. British favourite Chris Lambert had to settle for second place while defending champion Ireland's Paul Brizzel took third. There was some consolation for Lambert as he set a personal best of 20.94 in the first round - good enough to qualify for Europe.  Two-time AAAs champion Allyn Condon and Ian Mackie had no such luck as they were disqualified in the heats. There was plenty of hot action in the men's 60m hurdles where Scotland's  was vying for top spot with Olympian Andy Turner. Scott, 22, smashed his personal best on the way to the final, where he broke it again to win the AAAs title in 7.58 seconds. Turner finished second in 7.82 after previously setting a personal best on the 7.83 in the semi-finals, while Damien Greaves did not finish the final. The trio of athletes have reached the European qualifying mark this season though one of them is set to miss out on a call-up to the British squad.  comfortably defended her 3,000m title, clocking eight minutes, 49.87 seconds to easily surpass the European qualifying mark. The European cross country bronze medallist is ranked number one in Europe this season and will go to Madrid with high hopes. Helen Clitheroe was agonisingly close to the 9:05.00 qualifying mark as she claimed the runners-up spot in a personal best of 9:05.73. In the men's 800m heats,  qualified fastest in the 800m heats to lay down a challenge to in-form  . The Welsh runner attacked the last 200m to come through ahead of James Thie in one minute, 49.87 seconds. McIlroy, who is third in the European rankings, eased across the finish in 1:50.87 to set up a showdown in Sunday's final in Sheffield. Both Watkins and McIlroy have already achieved the European qualifying mark. Scotland's Susan Deacon stole  's thunder in the final of the women's 200m. Fraser became the fastest British woman over the distance this season when she qualified for the final in 23.68 seconds - though that time is outside the European standard. But Deacon claimed her first AAAs title over the distance, edging Fraser into second in 23.67. In the women's shot put veteran  claimed her fourth AAAs title with a throw of 15.27m. But that mark was not good enough for the 39-year-old to book her place at next month's European Indoor Championships in Madrid. Sotherton finished fifth after producing two throws of 13.77m. In the absence of injured British number one Carl Myerscough,  claimed the men's shot put title with a throw of 17.64m, which was below the qualifying mark.  Sale's Robert Mitchell climbed to a season's best of 2.20m - just 3cm short of the European standard - to claim the British indoor high jump title.  could only clear 2.16m to finish in fourth but the 27-year-old's disappointment will be tempered as he had already achieved the qualifying mark at a meeting in Slovenia on Tuesday. There was bad luck for British number one  in the pole vault as he failed to clear the bar after deciding to come in at 5.45m. The AAAs indoor title went instead to Ashley Swain, who climbed to a season's best of 5.25m And Ireland's Taniesha Scanlon set a new national record of 13.28m in the women's triple jump. \n",
      "85.0% McIlroy aiming for Madrid title  Northern Ireland man James McIlroy is confident he can win his first major title at this weekend's Spar European Indoor Championships in Madrid.  The 28-year-old has been in great form in recent weeks and will go in as one of the 800 metres favourites. \"I believe after my wins abroad and in our trial race in Sheffield, I can run my race from the front, back or middle,\" said McIlroy. New coach Tony Lester has helped get McIlroy's career back on track. The 28-year-old 800 metres runner has not always matched his promise with performances but believes his decision to change coaches and move base will bring the rewards. McIlroy now lives in Windsor and feels his career has been transformed by the no-nonsense leadership style of former Army sergeant Lester. Lester is better known for his work with 400m runners Roger Black and Mark Richardson in the past but under his guidance McIlroy has secured five wins this indoor season.  McIlroy now claims he is in his best shape since finishing fourth for Ireland at the outdoor European Championships in 1998. \"That was my last decent year,\" said McIlroy, who temporarily retired last August before returning to the sport under Lester's shrewd guidance. \"Before, every race was like trying to climb Mount Everest and I now know you can't do it on your own. \"Trying to succeed saw me sometimes standing half-dead and terrified on the starting line, which became a bit too much.\" McIlroy, who was compared to the likes of Sebastian Coe, Steve Cram and Steve Ovett in his younger days, is now competing without the benefit of National Lottery funding. That situation could change if he maintains his current form and repeats the world-class times he produced in the 800m and 1000m at major races in Erfurt and Stuttgart earlier this season. Russian Dmitriy Bogdanov won at the same Madrid venue last week and then claimed the European Championship race would be between himself, Dutchman Arnoud Okken and Antonio Reina of Spain but McIlroy is unfazed.  He admitted: \"He looked quite good in his win and fair enough everyone has the right to their own opinion. \"I never write myself off and let's face it, I haven't or looked like being beaten this season.\" And McIlroy, whose time of one minute 46.68seconds in Erfurt elevated him to sixth place on the UK All-Time list, is also already looking beyond Madrid. He said: \"I've been much more focused this year about my career and having such a good team around me has been very important. \"Ultimately of course, this weekend is a means to an end and that is getting prepared for the summer's world championships. \"That ambition has meant that I've had only two nights out since last August. The rest of my time has seen me just concentrating on rebuilding my career.\" \n",
      "84.7% European medal chances improve  What have the European Indoor trials told us? Well, I think we could be heading to the European Championships with half a dozen medal prospects.  It was good to see athletes beginning to make steps forward, to see a few new faces and there were lots of personal bests kicking around.  The best performance on the track for me was Sarah Claxton's win in the 60m hurdles. Running sub-eight seconds twice in a week puts her right up there and if she repeats that in Madrid she will be close to picking up a medal. But what was great about Sunday's performance was that she was under pressure to produce the goods when it counted. Diane Allahgreen has been our best hurdler for some time now and I think she was surprised to be beaten by Sarah. And knowing that she got the better of Diane in a head-to-head race will give Sarah confidence. In the men's race on Saturday, Allan Scott was right in there and there is definitely more to come from him. In fact, the men's 60m hurdles is so strong, I think the selectors will pick three hurdlers to go to Madrid.  Phillips Idowu lit up the field events, not only with his hair, but also with his leap of 17.30m, which puts him at the top of the world rankings. I had a chat with him before the competition and he was really looking forward to getting out there. He feels he is in great shape and has some big jumps inside him - but then Phillips always has. A lot of the athletes said the runway was not very helpful, so for Phillips to jump like that is a good performance. He is such a huge talent but just needs some consistency - and if he does that then the big jumps will get even further. Across the board I thought Kelly Sotherton had a great weekend and continued to show she is developing. She picked up three personal bests in the long jump, high jump and 60m hurdles and you can't ask for more than that. Kelly will be up against Carolina Kluft in the pentathlon at the European Championships but she has every chance of a medal on the basis of what we've seen so far.  She has a complicated training regime where different people help her with different disciplines but it seems to be working really well. It wasn't all good news in Sheffield. I thought both the 60m races were disappointing in different ways. Jason Gardener may have won but he wasn't at his best. I chatted to him afterwards and he knows it was an off-day for him. He's there to be shot at and the other lads nearly got a big scalp out there. In the women's race, Jeanette Kwayke was hoping to run against defending champion Joice Maduaka. The pair are enjoying a bit of rivalry but Joice had to pull out with a chest infection. If she had made the final I think Jeanette would have gone a bit quicker.  Janine Whitlock competed well in the pole vault on her return following a two-year drugs ban. But the most disappointing thing in the wider view is that she is our best pole vaulter by a long way and that shouldn't be the case. The event has moved on immensely since Janine has been away and if there was more domestic competition I think that would help her. A couple of other interesting topics to look out for are the citizenship issues surrounding Mark Findlay and Rabah Yusuf. Findlay is a Londoner who has chosen to represent Trinidad and Tobago but has never run for them so he could still compete for Great Britain. Yusuf, who came third in the 400m, is from the Sudan but is trying to gain British citizenship. He came to Britain as a high jumper but damaged his toe, started doing more running and found his talent. So we shall have to see what happens to both of them. \n",

      "88.4% Australia take control  Third Test, Sydney, day three (close): Australia 568; Pakistan 304 & 67-1  They put on 153 for the fifth wicket before Gilchrist fell to spinner Danish Kaneria for 113, a 120-ball innings which included five sixes. Ponting was bowled by Naved-ul-Hasan soon after and Kaneria worked his way through the tail for figures of 7-188. Australia were all out for 568, a lead of 264, with Pakistan 67-1 at stumps. The home side were anxious to make up for lost time after rain prevented any play during the morning session. Ponting resumed on 155, but was content to play second fiddle to Gilchrist, who set about the bowling in his customary forthright manner. He passed 4,000 Test runs as Australia added 169 during the afternoon and reached his 13th century in spectacular style with two sixes off Mohammad Asif to reach 92 and then two successive fours off Shahid Afridi. His captain, meanwhile, registered the highest score by an Australian batsman at the Sydney Cricket Ground when he passed Greg Chappell's 182 and was 196 not out at tea. He had lost Gilchrist by then, one of three stumping victims for Kamran Akmal, but newcomer Shane Watson looked solid in his first Test innings as they added 58. Ponting's 200 arrived off 311 balls with a boundary off Naved, but the bowler gained his revenge when the Australian skipper chopped a ball into his stumps.  He is now one of only 13 batsmen in history to score four or more double centuries in Tests - and only the third Australian after Sir Don Bradman and Chappell. His departure heralded a rush of five wickets in nine overs with Watson caught for 31 off Kaneria, who ended the innings with the wicket of Shane Warne for 16. It was the third time the 24-year-old leg-spinner had taken seven wickets in a Test innings. Facing such a sizeable deficit, Pakistan needed a good start to their second innings and Yasir Hameed and Salman Butt began with a flurry of boundaries. They put on 46 in nine overs, but the introduction of spin led to Butt's undoing as he flashed at a wide ball from Stuart MacGill and was caught at slip by Warne for 21. Hameed progressed to 40 not out off 46 balls, and new partner Younis Khan made five, before an offer of bad light from the umpires brought play to an end.

Asim Kamal top scored for the visitors with a well-made 87, but Australia were always in control after building a first-innings lead of 264. And on a turning wicket Shane Warne took 4-111 and Stuart MacGill 3-83. Australia took three wickets during the morning session to reduce Pakistan to 172-4, still 92 runs behind the home team's first-innings total.

At one point they had been reduced to 270-9 after steadily losing wickets throughout the afternoon session. Shortly before the scheduled tea interval Australia claimed the extra half hour as they went in search of victory. But Asim Kamal, partnered by Mohammad Asif, who scored his first runs in Test cricket, put on 55 for the last wicket to set Australia a meagre target for victory. Jason Langer and Matthew Hayden wasted no time in setting about the victory target, thrashing a series of boundaries.

      "87.3% Pakistan on revenge mission  Pakistan's cricketers depart for Delhi on Monday with captain Inzamam-ul-Haq beseeching his side to make up for the 2004 defeat to India on home soil.  India outplayed Pakistan 12 months ago, beating them 2-1 in the Tests and 3-2 in the one-day internationals. Inzamam said ahead of Pakistan's first full tour of India for six years: \"We want to make amends for last year. \"The Australian tour was a big learning experience and I think we are in a position to reap benefits in India.\" Series between India and Pakistan are always eagerly awaited, largely because politics often restrict the amount of cricket the two teams can play against each other. This particular engagement, which will include three Tests and six one-dayers, was twice threatened. The schedule has already been put back four days over a dispute which centred on Pakistan's refusal to play the second Test in Ahmedabad.  The first Test in Mohali will now get under way on 8 March. Then, following a protracted row over television rights, the Madras High Court issued interim orders to ensure the matches would be broadcast live by state=owned channel Doordarshan. After the 2004 series between the two sides, Pakistan sacked their coach Javed Miandad. Inzamam believes his replacement, Bob Woolmer, has improved the side even if a string of positive results have not yet come. He said: \"A lot has changed since that series. Woolmer has helped change the attitude of the boys which is more positive and professional and I think they can take the pressure of playing in India.\" Pakistan will be without strike bowler Shoaib Akhtar (hamstring), leaving recalled off-spinner Arshad Khan and leg-spinner Danish Kaneria with much work to do. Inzamam said: \"Shoaib's absence will be felt. But our strength is playing as a unit. \"[Khan and Kaneria] have a big role to play in India. They are the ones on whom we will be depending a lot in the Test matches. \"We are expecting slow, turning tracks and we have been practicing for such conditions.\" Pakistan's first match is a three-day warm-up against the Indian Board President's XI in Dharamsala from March 3.

      "87.1% Youhana leads from front  Second Test, Melbourne, day one (close): Pakistan 318-6 v Australia  Stand-in captain Yousuf Youhana led the way in Melbourne, smashing a superb ton and putting on 192 with Younis Khan. But the Australians hit back late when Youhana missed a Shane Warne full toss and was stumped for 111. Jason Gillespie, the pick of the bowlers with 3-72, then ousted Younis and Shoaib Malik in quick succession. Younis was caught behind by Adam Gilchrist off Gillespie's first delivery with the second new ball for 87.  And the paceman struck again in his next over when Malik was caught at slip by Ricky Ponting for seven, Pakistan losing three wickets for just 15 runs. Abdul Razzaq was not out on one and Kamran Akmal unbeaten on 16 at the close of play. Earlier, Salman Butt hit his maiden Test half-century as he put on 85 for the first wicket with Imran Farhat.  Michael Kasprowicz claimed the only wicket to fall before lunch when he had Farhat brilliantly caught by Ponting at slip for 20. But the hosts struck straight after the interval when Yasir Hameed was trapped leg before by Gillespie for two. Butt's brave knock came to an end when he was run out by a superb throw from Michael Clarke going for a second run. The opener had made 70 and his dismissal left Pakistan struggling on 94-3. but Youhana, filling in as captain for the injured Inzamam-ul-Haq, and Younis steadied the ship. Australia, who were lifted before the start of play by news that in-form opener Justin Langer was fit enough to take his place in the side, won the first Test in Perth by 491 runs.

The ground is 1,300 feet above sea level but Pakistan do not expect conditions to be a problem. \"We have played in Johannesburg, so altitude is not an issue,\" team manager Salim Altaf commented. Pakistan have a number of selection issues, but paln to field the same XI which plays against the President's XI in the first Test. Salman Butt, Yasir Hameed and Taufeeq Umar appear to be competing for two places at the top of the order. And there may only be room for two seamers from Mohammad Sami, Naved-ul-Hasan and Mohammad Khalil if Danish Kaneria and Arshad Khan are chosen to form a spin bowling partnership in Mohali. \"We expect pitches to turn in India and our players will have to learn to adapt themselves, but we have a talented batting line-up.

There was an important 72-run stand for the fifth wicket between Inzamam-ul-Haq and Asim Kamal after Pakistan had collapsed from 54-0 to 83-4. Kamal was still there at the close on 43 after captain Inzamam, on his 35th birthday, was dismissed for 35. Pakistan had been cruising early on through Salman Butt and Taufeeq Umar before losing four wickets for 29 runs in barely 10 overs of cricket. In the 11th over a misunderstanding with Umar about a second run resulted in his downfall - Gagandeep Singh hitting the stumps with a throw from fine leg.

Yousuf Youhana batted brightly but after hitting 18 off as many deliveries he fell soon after tea inside-edging a drive off Shib Paul to wicket-keeper Parthiv Patel.

      "84.9% Lara injury worry for West Indies  VB Series, Perth, Match nine: West Indies v Pakistan  Play starts Friday 0315 GMT  Lara is expected to play in Perth despite a wrist injury, with the winners taking on hosts Australia. Pedro Collins (thigh strain) and Ramnesh Sarwan (bruised elbow) are also injury concerns for the Windies. Pakistan are without leading bastman Younis Khan, who has flown home following the death of his father. Their skipper Inzamam-ul-Haq believes the three-wicket victory over Australia in Perth on Sunday will give his side the upper hand. He said: \"Definitely we have the advantage because we have played one Test match and played in Perth for 15 or 16 days before that. \"This track is totally different and West Indies are playing for the first time here. \"This win has definitely helped us for the coming games. Hopefully we will play the final and we will win,\" he added. Inzamam is wary of the in-form Lara after he belted 156 off 138 balls in a victory over Pakistan in Adelaide last Friday.  But he said his team had bowled better against Australia and warned Lara would need to be on top of his game with medium-pace bowler Naved-ul-Hasan and all-rounder Abdul Razzaq showing better form. \"I think he realises the bowling was not good in the last game. I think especially Naved and Razzaq have worked hard in the nets and they are good here.\" Lara conceded Pakistan may have the advantage but pointed out there were plenty of players within the West Indies squad, including himself, who had played at the Waca ground before. \"We've got some batsmen that have played here and we know exactly what the track is doing,\" said Lara.  \"It is more a mental game than the physical side and who has had more experience at the Waca. \"What I am worried about with Pakistan is that they are going to be playing three games in five days,\" he said. \"Hopefully that can play on their mind and we will have a tired bunch.\"  Inzamam-ul-Haq (captain), Shoaib Malik, Yousuf Youhana, Salman Butt, Kamran Akmal (wkt), Abdul Razzaq, Shahid Afridi, Naved-ul-Hasan, Yasir Hameed, Rao Iftikhar, Mohammad Khalil.

      "84.2% Parry firm over Gerrard  Listen to the full interview on Sport on Five and the BBC Sport website from 1900 GMT.  But Parry, speaking exclusively to BBC Sport, also admits Gerrard, who has been constantly linked with Chelsea, will have the final say on his future. He told BBC Five Live: \"Steven is above money. He is the future of Liverpool. \"It doesn't matter if it's Â£30m, Â£40m or Â£50m, we will not accept offers. But we are also realistic enough to know we can't keep Steven against his will.\" On the subject of Liverpool's finances, Parry also revealed the club is ready to explore the possibility of a sponsorship deal for its proposed new stadium.  And responding to criticism from BBC Sport pundit and former Liverpool stalwart Alan Hansen, he insisted talks on new investment are ongoing, but added the door has not closed on shareholder and lifelong fan Steve Morgan. Parry joined Liverpool as chief executive in July 1998 from a similar role at the Premier League. There have been several highs and lows during his time in charge at Anfield - and he had a busy summer, overseeing the arrival of new manager Rafael Benitez and managing to hold on to Steven Gerrard.  On the subject of Liverpool's captain and prize asset, Parry revealed Real Madrid  did  ask for an option on the England midfield man during negotiations for striker Fernando Morientes. He said: \"They were looking for ways of saying they got more out of the deal for Fernando Morientes, but the response to Real Madrid was the same - Steven is not for sale.\" But when asked if Gerrard would be a Liverpool player on the first day of next season, Parry said: \"I sincerely hope he will be. Steven knows my views. He knows Rafa's views. \"We have re-affirmed recently to Steven that we are trying to build a team around him. We crave success as much as he does. We know he's ambitious and nobody can argue with that.  \"I think Steven would dearly love to win things with Liverpool more than he'd like to do anything else. \"We all want to see progress by next season. He's not alone in that. There are a lot of other players who feel the same, so we all have a common aim.\" It is expected Chelsea will test Liverpool with a Â£30m-plus bid in the summer - but Parry claims he will be in no mood to listen. \"There have been a lot of open secrets about Steven, most of which have been complete myths. It is suggested we had a deal tied up last summer. We didn't had an offer last summer,\" Parry explained. \"We had told Chelsea that as far as we were concerned he was not for sale and we didn't want to sell him. In reality it didn't go beyond that. \"Maybe there will be an offer in the summer. Maybe there won't.  \"Our position is we want Steven to stay, but we are also realistic enough and have enough respect for Steven - and he has enough respect for us - to know that it is his decision that will be crucial. \"You are not going to keep a player like Steven against his will. That just doesn't work, but any idea we are going to accept offers for Steven and then tell him 'by the way we've decided to sell you' is not on the agenda. You can forget that.\" Parry is currently in the process of finalising funding for Liverpool's new stadium in Stanley Park, which is set to open in 2007. And he confessed Arsenal's Â£100m deal with Emirates to sponsor their new ground - complete with naming rights - has given the Anfield club serious food for thought. He said: \"I have to say historically it is something I have been against, and I have been on record as saying that, but I think the size of the Arsenal deal is a real eye-opener.  \"I would say in the past deals have been done frankly far too cheaply and it just hasn't even been worth contemplating. \"But the Arsenal deal is the sort of deal that causes you to draw breath and say 'wow - that's interesting.' \"My personal point of view is that I would find it a hell of a lot more palatable than a shared stadium.\" Some Liverpool fans would find such a move highly controversial, but Parry countered: \"I recognise it would be an emotive issue for many supporters, but you look at the amount of money available and it could go into the team. \"If it was the right partner how strong an issue is it? Time will tell. \"I think the stadium will always be Anfield, not least because of where it is, but do we need to investigate the possibilities of sponsorship? I think it would be remiss not to. \"That's not to say we have made a decision that we will go down that road, but I think it is clearly something we have to explore.\"  On the subject of possible new investment, Parry revealed Liverpool are still in negotiations with a mystery investor, with rumours of interest from the Middle East. That prompted the withdrawal of tycoon Steve Morgan, who got frustrated by failed bids and what he claimed was indecision by the board. He also accused Liverpool of using him as \"a stalking horse\" to attract other bids, but Parry explained: \"Steve has never been used as a stalking horse. There's no need, and that is not the way we do business. \"We had discussions with Steve over the course of 2004. I think we came close to concluding a deal in the summer but it didn't happen. \"Quite genuinely, the new interest did appear relatively late in the day just prior to the AGM in December, and as I have said it was of such potential magnitude, and that potential is so exciting, we felt we had to evaluate it. We are still evaluating it. \"Steve's interest was taken very much on its own merits. His enthusiasm for the club is there for all to see and who knows what the next few months will hold? \"The door isn't closed on anything. We had a perfectly sensible dialogue with Steve last year. \"We have a common interest in making Liverpool successful. That's a dream we all share, so as far as I'm concerned the door is not closed.\"  I would take Â£50m if we had no investment, but if we did, keep him. As for the stadium, if it gets us cash what difference does it make really?  Â£50m for Gerrard? I don't care who you are, the Directors would take the money and it is the way it should be. We cannot let that sum of money go, despite Gerrard's quality.  Through a cleverly worded statement, the club has effectively forced Gerrard to publicly make the decision for himself, which I think is the right thing to do.  Critical time for Liverpool with regards to Gerrard. Ideally we would want to secure his future to the club for the long term. I am hoping he doesn't walk out of the club like Michael Owen did for very little cash.  Â£50m realistically would allow Rafa to completely rebuild the squad, however, if we can afford to do this AND keep Gerrard we will be better for it. I would however be happy with Gerrard's transfer for any fee over Â£35m.  Parry's statements are clever in that any future Gerrard transfer cannot be construed as a lack of ambition by the club to not try and keep their best players. Upping the ante is another smart move by Parry.  I would keep Gerrard. No amount of money could replace his obvious love of the club and determination to succeed.  The key is if Gerrard comes out and says that he is happy. Clearly, if he isn't, then we would be foolish not to sell. The worrying thing is who would you buy (or who would come) pending possible non-Champions League football. \n",

      "90.6% Henman to face Saulnier test  British number one Tim Henman will face France's Cyril Saulnier in the first round of next week's Australian Open.  Greg Rusedski, the British number two, is in the same quarter of the draw and could face Andy Roddick in the second round if he beats Swede Jonas Bjorkman. Local favourite Lleyton Hewitt will meet France's Arnaud Clement, while defending champion and world number one Roger Federer faces Fabrice Santoro. Women's top seed Lindsay Davenport drew Spanish veteran Conchita Martinez.  Henman came from two sets down to defeat Saulnier in the first round of the French Open last year, so he knows he faces a tough test in Melbourne. The seventh seed, who has never gone beyond the quarter-finals in the year's first major and is lined up to meet Roddick in the last eight, is looking forward to the match. \"He's tough player on any surface, he's got a lot of ability,\" he said. \"We had a really tight one in Paris that went my way so I'm going to need to play well from the outset because he's a dangerous competitor.\" Switzerland's Federer, seeded one, is the hot favourite having won three of the four grand slam titles in 2004. He has beaten Santoro in five of their seven previous encounters, but is taking nothing for granted. \"It's a tricky match,\" Federer said. \"I played him at the US Open and won quite comfortably then. But you never know, if the rhythm is a bit off, he can keep you guessing and make it difficult. \"The most important thing, though, is to get used to playing five-set matches and winning them.\" The 23-year-old could meet four-time champion Andre Agassi in the quarter-finals before meeting Russian Marat Safin, the player he beat in last year's final.  Eighth-seeded American Agassi is set to play a qualifier in round one if he can shake off a hip injury which ruled him out of the Kooyong Classic. Second seed Andy Roddick will open his campaign against Irakli Labadze of Georgia. The American could meet Rusedski in the second round, seventh seed Henman in the quarter-finals and Hewitt in the last four. Hewitt is hoping to become the first Australian man to win the event since Mark Edmondson in 1976. The 23-year-old has never been beyond round four in eight attempts at Melbourne Park but has at least secured the opposite half of the draw to Federer, who beat him in the Australian Open, Wimbledon and US Open last year. Safin, seeded four, opens his campaign against a qualifier with 16th seed Tommy Haas, the player he beat in the semi-finals in 2002, a possible fourth-round opponent.  In the women's draw, Davenport could encounter eighth-seeded Venus Williams in the quarter-finals and third-ranked Anastasia Myskina, the French Open champion, in the semi-finals. Bronchitis ruled Davenport, the 2000 Australian Open champion, out of her Sydney quarter-final on Thursday. Venus Williams, who lost to younger sister Serena in the Melbourne final two years ago, opens against Eleni Daniilidou of Greece. Serena Williams, who won her fourth consecutive grand slam at the 2003 Australian Open, was drawn in the bottom quarter with second seed Amelie Mauresmo, a runner-up in 1999. Serena will open against another Frenchwoman Camille Pin, while Mauresmo plays Australia's Samantha Stosur. Wimbledon champion Maria Sharapova, seeded fourth, drew a qualifier in the first round but could meet fellow Russian Svetlana Kuznetsova, the US Open winner, in the last eight  1 Roger Federer (Switzerland)  2 Andy Roddick (US)  3 Lleyton Hewitt (Australia)  4 Marat Safin (Russia)  5 Carlos Moya (Spain)  6 Guillermo Coria (Argentina)  7 Tim Henman (Britain)  8 Andre Agassi (US)  9 David Nalbandian (Argentina)  10 Gaston Gaudio (Argentina)  11 Joachim Johansson (Sweden)  12 Guillermo Canas (Argentina)  13 Tommy Robredo (Spain)  14 Sebastien Grosjean (France)  15 Mikhail Youzhny (Russia)  16 Tommy Haas (Germany)  17 Andrei Pavel (Romania)  18 Nicolas Massu (Chile)  19 Vincent Spadea (US)  20 Dominik Hrbaty (Slovakia)  21 Nicolas Kiefer (Germany)  22 Ivan Ljubicic (Croatia)  23 Fernando Gonzalez (Chile)  24 Feliciano Lopez (Spain)  25 Juan Ignacio Chela (Argentina)  26 Nikolay Davydenko (Russia)  27 Paradorn Srichaphan (Thailand)  28 Mario Ancic (Croatia)  29 Taylor Dent (US)  30 Thomas Johansson (Sweden)  31 Juan Carlos Ferrero (Spain)  32 Jurgen Melzer (Austria)  1 Lindsay Davenport (US)  2 Amelie Mauresmo (France)  3 Anastasia Myskina (Russia)  4 Maria Sharapova (Russia)  5 Svetlana Kuznetsova (Russia)  6 Elena Dementieva (Russia)  7 Serena Williams (US)  8 Venus Williams (US)  9 Vera Zvonareva (Russia)  10 Alicia Molik (Australia)  11 Nadia Petrova (Russia)  12 Patty Schnyder (Switzerland)  13 Karolina Sprem (Croatia)  14 Francesca Schiavone (Italy)  15 Silvia Farina Elia (Italy)  16 Ai Sugiyama (Japan)  17 Fabiola Zuluaga (Colombia)  18 Elena Likhovtseva (Russia)  19 Nathalie Dechy (France)  20 Tatiana Golovin (France)  21 Amy Frazier (US)  22 Magdalena Maleeva (Bulgaria)  23 Jelena Jankovic (Serbia and Montenegro)  24 Mary Pierce (France)  25 Lisa Raymond (US)  26 Daniela Hantuchova (Slovakia)  27 Anna Smashnova (Israel)  28 Shinobu Asagoe (Japan)  29 Gisela Dulko (Argentina)  30 Flavia Pennetta (Italy)  31 Jelena Kostanic (Croatia)  32 Iveta Benesova (Czech Republic) \n",
      "86.8% Moya suffers shock loss  Fifth seed Carlos Moya was the first big name to fall at the Australian Open as he went down to fellow Spaniard Guillermo Garcia-Lopez on Monday.  Moya began the year with victory at the Chennai Open but looked out of sorts from the start in the Melbourne heat. Garcia-Lopez, ranked 106 in the world, dominated from the outset and withstood a third-set rally from Moya to hang on for a 7-5 6-3 3-6 6-3 victory. The 21-year-old plays Kevin Kim or Lee Hyuung-Taik in the second round. Garcia-Lopez was delighted with the victory in only his third ever Grand Slam match. \"I think this was the most important win of my life as Carlos is one of the best players in the world,\" he said. \"This has given me a lot of confidence. Now I feel I can beat all these players.\" Moya said: \"I was playing well before I came here. It was the perfect preparation but something was wrong today.\"  Four-time champion Andre Agassi began what could be his last Australian Open with a convincing win over German qualifier Dieter Kindlmann. The 34-year-old American, who had been struggling with a hip injury earlier in the week, stormed to a 6-4 6-3 6-0 win. Agassi will play France's Olivier Patience or Germany's Rainer Schuettler - the man he beat in the 2003 final - in the next round. \"No one was more concerned (about the injury) than myself,\" said eighth seed Agassi. \"I'd worked hard to be down here and ready. But the last few days, I've pushed through the injury and it seemed to do pretty good.\" In other matches, world junior champion Gael Monfils made use of his wild card with a magnificent 1-6 6-3 6-4 7-6 (8-6) win over American Robby Ginepri. The 2002 champion Thomas Johansson fought back to beat Peter Luczak 7-6 (7-5) 4-6 6-3 4-6 6-0, and French Open champion Gaston Gaudio beat Justin Gimelstob 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 6-3. Seeds Dominik Hrbaty, Ivan Ljubicic and Mario Ancic made comfortable progress, but former French Open champion Albert Costa lost to Bjorn Phau. \n",
      "86.8% White prepared for battle  Tough-scrummaging prop Julian White is expecting a resurgent Wales to give him a rough ride in England's Six Nations opener in Cardiff on Saturday.  The Leicester tight-head is in the form of his life, making the England number three shirt his own. But he knows Wales will put his technique under immense scrutiny. \"The Welsh scrum is a force to be reckoned with,\" he told BBC Sport. \"They have made a lot of changes for the better over the last few years.\" White is also impressed with the Welsh pack's strength in depth. \"Gethin Jenkins is starting at loose-head for them. He has played a bit at tight-head but I think his favoured position is loose-head and he is very good,\" he added. The 31-year-old has made a massive contribution to the England and Leicester cause of late and is arguably the form tight-head prop in the world.  He destroyed South Africa's Os du Randt in the scrum at Twickenham last autumn to give England the platform for an impressive 32-16 victory. Leicester, who signed White from Bristol when the West Country side were relegated from the Zurich Premiership in the summer of 2003, have also been aided by White's presence this season. The Tigers are sitting pretty at the top of the Premiership table and have also booked their place in the last eight of the Heineken Cup. \"I am pleased with my form,\" he said. \"But my form is helped by the people I play with at Leicester - people like Martin Johnson and Graham Rowntree. \"It's been a good season so far and to be in the starting XV for the first game of the Six Nations is what every player wants. \"I am delighted with the way things have gone but we have to get it right this weekend.\" White is now one of the more experienced members of the England squad which takes to the field on Saturday. Injuries have taken their toll and coach Andy Robinson has been deprived of Richard Hill, Jonny Wilkinson, Martin Corry, Mike Tindall, Will Greenwood and Stuart Abbott.  And with 27 caps and a World Cup winner's medal to his name, White is now in a position to offer his experience to youngsters such as centres Matthew Tait and Jamie Noon. \"I don't know how much experience a tight-head can give a centre but you are there to give them a pat on the back if things go wrong or to be there if they want to talk in any way,\" he added. \"When I first came into the squad, people like Jason Leonard and Martin Johnson were the first to come over and talk through things and help out.  \"It gives you a lot of confidence when people like that speak to you. \"I was in awe of a lot of them so to sit down and speak with them and realise you are on the same wavelength is good.\" White missed the vast majority of last year's Six Nations because of a knee injury and is raring for the 2005 event to get going. And that is despite the opening game taking place amid the red-hot atmosphere in Cardiff. \"I enjoy the atmosphere. The Millennium Stadium is probably one of the best stadiums in the world,\" he said. \"To go down there and hear the shouting and the singing - it's one of my favourite places to play. \"This is probably the most even Six Nations for a long time. England, Ireland, France and Wales are all contenders. \"On form, Ireland should be favourites but you just don't know - that's the great thing about this tournament.\" \n",
      "86.5% India's top six secure - Ganguly  Captain Sourav Ganguly has revealed India will not be tempted into tinkering with their batting order for the first Test against Pakistan.  \"Our batting order for the Tests is fixed. There are no changes from number three to six,\" Ganguly told BBC Sport. It means Rahul Dravid will remain at number three and VVS Laxman at six, despite the latter averaging 53.5 at first drop in Test cricket. \"To be honest, Dravid has batted better than Laxman at three,\" Ganguly added. \"If you ask any batsman, he would like to bat higher up, as it gives a greater opportunity to score. \"While batting lower down the order, you have to play more with the tail.\" Ganguly gave his backing to Gautam Gambhir, banishing speculation Yuvraj Singh could be asked to open the batting again after a failed experiment against Australia last year.  \"I feel there is no born opener - the team has to find one,\" he stated. \"Look at Justin Langer, he was not an opener, but how well the Aussies have groomed him. Virender Sehwag is a settled opener now both in Tests and one-dayers, and Gambhir is doing well. \"In a year's time, we should have a settled opening pair.\" Sachin Tendulkar, who will bat at number four with Ganguly at five, also received the support of his skipper despite concerns over fitness and form. \"When Sachin says he is 100 percent fit, he is, and nobody has a right to talk about the form of a man who has 70 international hundreds.\" With wicket-keeper Dinesh Karthik to come in at number seven, India are left with just four spots for bowlers - suggesting Yuvraj could miss out.  Mohali, which will host the first Test starting on 8 March, is known as a seam-friendly pitch and India have included four pacemen in their 14-man squad. In addition to spinners Anil Kumble and Harbhajan Singh, India will be forced to choose from the pace quartet of Irfan Pathan, Zaheer Khan, Ashish Nehra and Lakshmipathy Balaji. \"In Kumble and Harbhajan, we have two world class spinners and at the moment there is no place for a third one,\" Ganguly said. \"Our seam attack had done particularly well during the Pakistan tour last year, and we will select the final eleven after having a look at the wickets in Mohali, which has had a record of a seaming track.\" Ganguly refused to get carried away with the fact Pakistan's pace attack has been depleted with the absence of Shoaib Akhtar through injury.  \"I feel Pakistan has a young and fit team, which is hungry for success. In my view they have done the right thing by bringing a fit team, rather than bringing injured players,\" he said. \"It is better to have a fully fit team than having an injured Shoaib Akhtar or even Don Bradman for that matter. \"I do not agree with those who say Pakistan's team is weak and has given India a walkover. \"It will be a tough series and the next 50 days will be a treat for fans of both sides.\" \n",

      "86.4% Edgy Agassi struggles past Dent  Andre Agassi put in an erratic display before edging into the fourth round of the Australian Open with victory over Taylor Dent.  The 34-year-old American, seeded eighth, made a poor start, dropping serve early on and later needing two chances to serve out the set. Having secured the lead, Agassi still failed to take control as both players forced a succession of breaks. But Agassi won the tie-break before wrapping up a 7-5 7-6 (7-3) 6-1 win. Fourth seed  survived an injury scare as he battled past Mario Ancic 6-4 3-6 6-3 6-4. The Russian turned his right ankle in the third game of the fourth set and called for treatment immediately. But he showed no sign of the problem when he returned to the court to wrap up victory in two hours 45 minutes.  Ancic, Wimbledon semi-finalist in 2004, looked set to push Safin all the way when he took the second set but Safin raised his game to sink the Croatian. Safin said he was trying to keep his temper under control at this year's tournament. The Russian hit himself on the head repeatedly in one second-set outburst but was otherwise largely calm in his victory. \"I try to stay calm because if you go crazy against players like Ancic, you might never come back because he's a tough opponent,\" he said. \"I'm a little bit calmer than I was before because I'd had enough.\" The Russian added that he was not worried by his ankle injury. \"I have had a lot of problems with that ankle before - it will be OK,\" he said.  's route to the fourth round was made easy when opponent Jarkko Nieminen was forced to retire from their match.  The top seed and defending champion was leading 6-3 5-2 when Nieminen pulled out with an abdominal injury. Federer had been in patchy form until then - mixing 19 unforced errors with 19 winners. The world number one will play Cypriot  next after the former world junior champion beat Tommy Robredo 7-6 (7-2) 6-4 6-1. Federer admitted he was under extra pressure after extending his winning streak to a career-best 24. \"They are so used to me winning, but it's not that simple,\" he said. \"I had a feeling this could be a tough match. I had a bad start but I bounced back. I always want to play better than I am, but I thought I was pretty OK.\" French Open champion  is out of the tournament after a five-set defeat by Dominik Hrbaty. Hrbaty defeated the 10th seed 7-6 (7-5) 6-7 (8-10) 6-7 (3-7) 6-1 6-3 in a match lasting four hours and 21 minutes. The pair traded 16 service breaks during an exhausting baseline battle, with Hrbaty taking a decisive advantage in the eighth game of the final set. Hrbaty will now play 2002 champion  , who outlasted American Kevin Kim 3-6 6-2 6-7 6-2 6-2. \n",
      "86.0% Vickery out of Six Nations  England tight-head prop Phil Vickery has been ruled out of the rest of the 2005 RBS Six Nations after breaking a bone in his right forearm.  Vickery was injured as his club side, Gloucester, beat Bath 17-16 in the West country derby on Saturday. He could be joined on the sidelines by Bath centre Olly Barkley, who sat out the derby due to a leg injury. Barkley will have a scan on Sunday and might miss England's trip to Six Nations leaders Ireland next weekend. The news is just the latest blow for coach Andy Robinson, who has seen his side lose their opening two matches in the 2005 Six Nations. Robinson is already without World Cup winners Jonny Wilkinson, Will Greenwood, Mike Tindall, Richard Hill and Trevor Woodman through injury. Vickery has broken the radius, a large bone in his forearm. He only returned to the England side last weekend after a long-term back injury, which was followed by a fractured eye socket. And the Gloucester prop was only recalled after Leicester tight-head Julian White suffered a neck injury which has already seen him ruled out of the Ireland game.  Bath prop Matt Stevens is the only remaining tight-head in England's training squad and could be involved against Ireland. But he has to play second fiddle at club level to Duncan Bell, who excelled for England A against France and may now be called into the squad. The extent of Barkley's injury is not yet clear but Bath boss John Connolly rates him no better than \"50-50\" to face Ireland. Barkley played at inside cente in England's defeat by France and if he is unable to play, England's constantly-changing midfield will once again have to be altered.  Robinson could choose to recall Mathew Tait or Henry Paul, although Tait endured a nightmare for Newcastle against Leicester on Saturday and Paul limped off with an ankle injury against Bath. In-form Leicester centre Ollie Smith is the other outstanding candidate, and two tries against Newcastle will have boosted his chances. Fly-half Andy Goode is also a strong contender for the match-day 22 after an immaculate kicking display on Saturday. England, fourth in the Six Nations table with zero points, play Ireland, top of the table, in Dublin on 27 February, kick-off 1500 GMT. \n",
      "85.9% Bell set for England debut  Bath prop Duncan Bell has been added to England's 30-man squad to face Ireland in the RBS Six Nations.  And with Phil Vickery sidelined for at least six weeks with a broken arm and Julian White out with a neck injury, Bell could make his England debut. Bell, 30, had set his sights on an international career with Wales. But last December, the International Rugby Board confirmed that he could only be eligible for England as he had travelled on tour with them in 1998. England coach Andy Robinson could take a gamble and call inexperienced Sale Sharks prop Andrew Sheridan into his front row. But Sheridan favours the loosehead side of the scrum and a more likely scenario is for uncapped Bell - who was among the tryscorers when England A beat France A 30-20 nine days ago - to be drafted in. Robinson also has an injury worry over centre Olly Barkley, who withdrew from Bath's starting line-up to face Gloucester last weekend.  He was due to have a hospital scan on Monday, while Gloucester centre Henry Paul, who started at fly-half against Bath, limped out at Kingsholm because of an ankle problem. Despite Barkley's three missed penalties in the 18-17 defeat against France, he is expected to retain his place at inside centre, although Leicester's in-form prospect Ollie Smith would be an obvious replacement. Bath coach John Connolly rates Barkley as no better than a 50/50 chance to make the Dublin trip. Uncapped fly-half Andy Goode has been named in a 30-man training squad for the Ireland game, and he strengthened his selection claims by kicking 28 points during Leicester's record 83-10 win against Newcastle on Sunday. England's players are due to meet at their Surrey training base on Monday. \n",
      "85.7% Kaif shines in India win  First one-day international, Chittagong: India 245-8 (50 overs) v Bangladesh 234-8 (50 overs) by 11 runs  Mohammad Kaif (80) and Rahul Dravid (53) shared a stand of 128 as the tourists posted a total of 245-8. Skipper Habibul Bashar kept Bangladesh in the hunt with 65, but his departure left them with too much to do. Khaled Mashud hit an unbeaten 50 but Sridharan Sriram took 3-43 as the home side were restricted to 234-8. After winning the Test series 2-0, India took the opportunity to rest batsman Virender Sehwag and fast bowler Zaheer Khan and give debuts to wicket-keeper Mahendra Dhoni and seamer Joginder Sharma. But skipper Sourav Ganguly lost the toss and opposite number Bashar's decision to put them in paid off initially as India were reduced to 45-3. Ganguly was bowled for nought by the second ball of the match from Tapash Baisya and 17-year-old Nazmul Hossain then claimed the prized scalp of Sachin Tendulkar, who was caught behind for 19.  Mushfiqur Rahman trapped Yuvraj Singh lbw for 21, but Kaif and Dravid steadied the innings and Bangladesh had to wait 28 overs for their next success. Both batsmen reached their half centuries off 74 balls, but Dravid edged a catch to the keeper off Khaled Mahmud soon after and Sriram was stumped for three off spinner Mohammad Rafique. Dhoni's first innings for India lasted one delivery as he was run out for nought and when Kaif gave a return catch to Nazmul in the 47th over, the total had only just passed 200. But Ajit Agarkar made 25 and Irfan Pathan hit two sixes in his 21 not out off 11 balls, runs which ultimately made all the difference.  Bangladesh were soon in trouble in reply as Rafique (eight), Nafis Iqbal (nine) and Mohammad Ashraful (two) all failed - the latter becoming Sharma's first international victim when he was caught by Ganguly. Bashar and Aftab Ahmed put on 64 in 14 overs before both fell victim to Sriram's left-arm spin, along with Rajin Saleh (14), as the home side slumped from 108-3 to 156-6. Mushfique was lbw to Agarkar for two but Mashud and Mahmud did their best to revive their side, adding 40 for the eighth wicket in six overs. The target was out of reach, however, and Mahmud perished for 21 to a catch by Man of the Match Kaif as Bangladesh's hopes were finally extinguished. Mashud had the consolation of reaching his fifth one-day half century before Baisya drove the final ball of the game to extra cover for four, but it was too late for Bangladesh.  Nafis Iqbal, Habibul Bashar (Capt), Mohammad Ashraful Aftab Ahmed, Khaled Mashud (Wkt), Mushfiqur Rahman, Khaled Mahmud Manjural Islam Rana, Mohammad Rafique, Tapash Baisya Nazmul Hossain.  S Sriram, S R Tendulkar, S C Ganguly (Capt), R Dravid Yuvraj Singh, M Kaif, M S Dhoni (Wkt), I K Pathan, Harbhajan Singh J Sharma, A B Agarkar.  Aleem Dar and Mahbubur Rahman \n",
      "85.5% Kaif absence wrong - Azharuddin  India were wrong to leave Mohammad Kaif out of their squad for the first Test against Pakistan, according to former captain Mohammad Azharuddin.  Azharuddin, serving a life ban for match-fixing, feels the middle-order batsman deserves another chance. \"Kaif batted very well against Australia on a tough wicket,\" Azharuddin told BBC Sport. \"He's got a lot of talent and I am sure he cannot be held back. His omission is not good for his confidence.\" Kaif scored two fifties in last year's home series loss to the Aussies, while Yuvraj Singh failed badly against the same opponents yet was given a squad berth for the Mohali Test starting on 8 March.  Azharuddin reckons Vangipurappu Laxman should bat at first drop despite struggling for form. \"Laxman has always played well when he has gone as number three,\" he said. \"Lower down the order, a lot of pressure is on him and if I were the captain, I would have played him at number three.\" As well as spinners Harbhajan Singh and Anil Kumble, India have four pacemen to choose from after naming Ashish Nehra, Lakshmipathy Balaji, Irfan Pathan and Zaheer Khan in the 14-man squad. \"All the four pace bowlers deserve to get into the team,\" Azharuddin added. Pakistan, minus injured paceman Shoaib Akhtar, are due to arrive in India on Monday ahead of their first warm-up match against the Indian Board President's XI starting on Thursday. \"Shoaib Akhtar's absence in the Pakistani side is not going to make much of a difference,\" Azharuddin opined. \"He may get a wicket or two but he has to be more consistent. Also, the Indian batting is very strong now.\"  Azharuddin maintains his innocence despite his central involvement in the match-fixing scandal of 2000 which saw Pakistani Salim Malik and the late Hansie Cronje of South Africa also receive life bans. In 99 Tests for India from 1984 to 2000, Azharuddin scored 6,215 runs at an average of 45 with 22 centuries. \n",

    "1. Identify **three pairs of documents** in the McDonalds review dataset that have over 0.85 cosine similarity using average token word2vec embeddings from spacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Using the `SMS_test` and `SMS_train` datasets, build a classification model (you can simply use the `sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` model used. Please attempt at least two of the vectorization techniques below:\n",
    "* `CountVectorization`\n",
    "* `TfIdfVectorization`\n",
    "* `word2vec` spacy document-level vectors\n",
    "* if you pick Count or TfIdf Vectorization -> you MUST reduce dimensionality.\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you perform the following:\n",
    "* use train/test split\n",
    "* use proper model evaluation metrics\n",
    "* text preprocessing (regex, stemming/lemmatization, stopword removal, grouping entities, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A discussion of the following:\n",
    "* **What techniques** you tried to improve the performance of your model.\n",
    "* What you would try to do, given more time, that would improve the performance of your model.\n",
    "* Provide an example of two **error cases** - a false positive and a false negative - that your model got wrong, and why the model did not predict the correct answer."
